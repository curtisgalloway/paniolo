"""Tests for ocr/linuxocr's bbox mapping (docs/dev/ocr.md's v1 OCR contract).

`ocr/linuxocr` has no .py suffix -- it's installed and run directly as a
script -- so it's loaded by path with importlib rather than imported as a
regular module.

These tests exercise `_clip_to_source` (the pure corner-mapping-and-clipping
math) directly, plus one integration test through `_lines_from_tsv`. Neither
needs Pillow: that is only used by `_preprocess`, which these tests never
call.
