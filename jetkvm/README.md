# jetkvm — JetKVM network KVM helper for paniolo

`jetkvm` is a paniolo `hid` helper for the [JetKVM](https://jetkvm.com/), a
network KVM that plugs into the target over USB and HDMI and is reached over
the network. It has the **same CLI surface** as [`ch9329`](../ch9329/README.md)
and [`hidrig`](../hidrig/README.md) (`type`, `key`, `combo`, `down`, `up`,
`releaseall`, `move`, `moveabs`, `click`, `mdown`, `mup`, `scroll`, `ping`,
`version`, `run`, `serve`, `stop`), so it drops into a `hid` channel:

```
paniolo hid set -t target-machine --cmd "jetkvm -d 192.0.2.10"
```

It is written in Go because the device's firmware (0.5.9) exposes keyboard and
mouse **only over WebRTC**, and the Go WebRTC stack
([pion](https://github.com/pion/webrtc)) is the practical way to speak it.
Milestone 1 covers keyboard and mouse injection; milestone 2 adds video (see
[Video](#video-get-rfb)). Virtual media and power are not part of this helper.

## How it talks to the device

1. `POST http://<host>/auth/login-local` with the password; the reply sets an
   `authToken` cookie.
2. A WebSocket to `/webrtc/signaling/client` (with that cookie) carries the
   WebRTC offer and answer.
3. One data channel labeled `rpc` carries JSON-RPC 2.0 text messages:
   `keyboardReport`, `absMouseReport`, `relMouseReport`, `wheelReport`,
   `ping`, `getUSBState`, `getVideoState`, `getKeyboardLedState`. One-shot
   commands negotiate no media. The `serve` daemon also offers a receive-only
   H.264 video track (see below).

## The one-session rule

JetKVM allows **one session at a time**. A new offer closes the current
session, which is told with an `otherSessionConnected` event. Consequences:

- Opening the JetKVM web UI while `jetkvm serve` is running kicks the daemon,
  and a `jetkvm` command kicks your browser tab.
- `jetkvm serve` holds one session and every one-shot routes through it, so
  many commands cost one login, not one each.
- When the daemon is kicked it logs that clearly and does **not** reconnect on
  its own (that would fight the person using the browser). The next command
  you send reconnects. A plain network drop is retried in the background with
  backoff (1 s up to 30 s).

## Password

Never a flag value. In order, the first source that is set wins:

1. `JETKVM_PASSWORD` in the environment
2. `--password-file <path>` (one trailing newline dropped; a warning if the
   file is readable by group or others)
3. `--password-command '<cmd>'` (run with `sh -c`, 30 s limit; stdout is the
   password), e.g. `--password-command 'op read op://vault/jetkvm/password'`

A missing password or a rejected one exits 3.

## Video (`GET /rfb`)

`jetkvm serve` can relay the device's HDMI capture. The offer carries a
receive-only **H.264-only** video m-line (H.265 is never offered), so the video
rides the *same* session the daemon already holds; the device allows only one.
The track's RTP is depacketized to Annex-B and piped to an **`ffmpeg`
subprocess** (`ffmpeg -flags low_delay -f h264 -i pipe:0 -f rawvideo -pix_fmt
bgr0 pipe:1`), which must be installed. The path is `--ffmpeg PATH` on
`serve`, else `ffmpeg` on `PATH`, else `/opt/homebrew/bin`, `/usr/local/bin`,
`/usr/bin`. Without ffmpeg the daemon starts, HID works, no video track is
offered, and `/rfb` answers 503 with the reason.

Decoding is lazy. The first `/rfb` client connects the session if it is down
and starts ffmpeg; about 10 s after the last client leaves, ffmpeg is killed.
A keyframe is requested (RTCP PLI) when decoding starts, after a reconnect,
and every 3 s until the first frame decodes. Only the newest decoded frame is
kept. A resolution change (from the stream's SPS) restarts ffmpeg.

`GET /rfb` is a WebSocket upgrade on the daemon's HTTP port, behind the same
auth as every route (token in `Authorization: Bearer` or `?token=`, loopback
Host/Origin). The subprotocol `binary` is accepted when offered (noVNC), else
none. Each binary message carries any chunk of the RFB byte stream, in either
direction; message boundaries mean nothing. The server speaks RFB 3.8
(3.7 and 3.3 clients also work):

- security type None only; framebuffer 32 bpp, depth 24, true-color,
  little-endian, shifts R16 G8 B0, name `jetkvm`
- `SetPixelFormat`: any 32 bpp true-color format is honored by converting;
  anything else is logged and the connection closed
- `SetEncodings`: only Raw is sent, plus DesktopSize (-223) when advertised
  and the size changed (sent in the same update, ahead of the Raw rectangle);
  a client without DesktopSize is disconnected on a resize
- `FramebufferUpdateRequest`: incremental requests block until a frame newer
  than the last one sent exists; non-incremental ones get the current frame.
  Each reply is the whole frame as one Raw rectangle. Until the first frame
  decodes, a request waits up to 10 s, then gets a black frame at the last
  known size (default 1920x1080)
- `KeyEvent`, `PointerEvent`, `ClientCutText`: read and ignored. Input goes
  through the `hid` path for now.

`GET /status` includes `video`: `available`, `decoding`, `width`, `height`,
`frames_decoded`, `last_frame_age_ms` (-1 before the first frame) and `error`.
`jetkvm info` appends the same object as `stream=<json>` when a daemon is
running.

Caveats: the one-session rule applies, so a browser tab kicks the daemon and
its video stops until the next `/rfb` attach or command. TODO: send only dirty
rectangles (every update is a full Raw frame, about 8 MB at 1080p), and
request a keyframe after RTP loss.

## `ok` is not "delivered"

The firmware answers every HID call with success even when the target's USB
host has not enumerated the device (target off, in firmware, cable out). Use
`jetkvm info` to see the USB state, video state and keyboard LEDs.

## Commands

See [docs/hid.md](../docs/hid.md) and the
[HID serial protocol](../docs/dev/hid-serial-protocol.md). JetKVM-specific:

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `info` | Prints `usb=… video=… leds=…` from the device |
| `version` | `1 jetkvm/<ver> moveabs` (needs no device or password) |
| `serve [--port N] [--ffmpeg PATH]` | Runs the daemon; serves video on `/rfb` when ffmpeg is found |

`click`, `mdown` and `mup` use the relative-mouse report with zero motion, so
they act wherever the pointer already is; a preceding `moveabs` picks the
spot.

## Exit codes

| Code | Meaning |
|---|---|
| 0 | success |
| 1 | the command failed (device error, unreachable, timeout) |
| 2 | usage error |
| 3 | no password, or the device rejected it |

## Build and test

```
cd jetkvm
go build .
gofmt -l . ; go vet ./... ; go test -race ./...
```

The tests include a fake JetKVM (login, signaling and a pion answerer, which
can also play an H.264 clip) driven end to end. The ffmpeg tests skip when
ffmpeg is not installed. `paniolo setup` builds this helper into the private libexec dir
when `go` is on PATH. Release packaging (the `.deb`, tarball, zip and
Homebrew keg) is not wired up yet.
