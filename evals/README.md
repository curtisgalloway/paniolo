# paniolo agent-eval suite

Runnable fixtures for the eval design in
[`docs/agent-evals.md`](../docs/agent-evals.md): can a *naive* agent go from a
plain-language goal to the correct paniolo command via the CLI's self-describing
surface (`paniolo --help` → `paniolo skill` → docs), without inventing commands?

**No hardware.** Every scenario is either **T1** (config-only — the agent really
runs paniolo against a throwaway lab file, graded by inspecting the resulting
`lab.toml`) or **T0** (stated-commands — the agent says what it would run, graded
by an LLM judge). Stdlib-only **Python 3.11+** (uses `tomllib`); no
`pip`/`uv`/network needed. Agent mode also needs the `claude` CLI on PATH.

> On this machine the stock `python3` is 3.9 — use `python3.12` (or any
> 3.11+). The examples below do.

## Status (2026-06) — what's built and verified

**Built:** 31 scenarios (c1–c8 config, r1–r8 runtime, s1–s10 serial, m1–m5 meta —
r8 power-state, m3 discover, m4 helper, m5 setup added to cover the last few CLI
groups); the scripted T1 grader + LLM-judge; a `run.py --check` **drift guard**
(every scenario reference + the T1-safe allowlist is validated against the live
`--help` surface, so a renamed subcommand or dropped flag fails loudly instead of
silently rotting the references); the `run.py` orchestrator (sandbox, three
discovery conditions, reference/agent modes); `serial_loopback.py`. Two agent
CLIs are wired: `claude` (`-p`, prompt on stdin) and `agy` (`-p`, prompt as
argument). The judge supports both and injects paniolo's real `--help` tree as
the COMMAND REFERENCE so invent-resistance is graded against ground truth; it
also evaluates each scenario trap explicitly and applies a concrete weighted
pass rule (not a holistic "looks adequate"). The T1 graders for c3/c7 assert the
full power-hook wiring (shellyplug on/off/state; `adb -s <serial> reboot`), not
just the headline command.

**Verified runs (all unstaged; results overwrite per mode+condition):**
- Reference golden self-test — every T1 scenario PASSes (`run.py --all --reference`).
- **agy, cold** — full T1 set **9/9** (c1–c8, s1); **r-series 7/7** (claude-judged);
  T0 sample s2/s4/m2 **3/3**. agy did genuine cold discovery (help/skill probing).
- Not yet run: remaining T0 serial (s3, s5–s10) with an agent; the **warm** and
  **preloaded** conditions (i.e. the discovery-delta experiment is not done yet);
  a cross-model judge across the whole suite.

**Runner hardening (from real failures):** T0 scenarios get a "you may probe
`--help`/`skill` but don't execute the operational commands" guard (an agent that
ran `netif mode ffx` blocked on `sudo`); per-scenario 360 s timeout that's caught
(one hang ≠ dead batch); `stdin=DEVNULL`; per-scenario `try/except` + incremental
result save; a `daemons stop --all` sweep after each agent run.

**Known platform limits:** `serial_loopback.py` is Linux-only (macOS pty → ENOTTY,
SKIPs); `--isolation home` needs valid creds (macOS Keychain `.credentials.json`
can be stale → 401). agy bypasses the PATH shim, so its T1 allowlist isn't
enforced (graded on `lab.toml` outcome). See `docs/agent-evals.md` §3.1, §6.2, §8.

## Layout

```
evals/
  run.py                 orchestrator (sandbox + condition + run + grade)
  serial_loopback.py     Linux: execute the 'operating serial' scenarios for real
  scenarios/*.toml       27 scenarios — c1–c8 config, r1–r7 runtime,
                         s1–s10 serial, m1–m2 meta
  fixtures/*.toml        seed lab files for scenarios that start from a state
  graders/
    t1_config.py         scripted grader: lab.toml assertions + T1-safe allowlist
    judge.py             builds the LLM-judge prompt (and can call a judge)
  results/               written per run (gitignored)
```

## Quick start

```bash
cd evals

# what's here ( * = core set )
python3.12 run.py --list

# drift guard: every scenario reference + the T1-safe allowlist must match the
# live CLI surface. Run this first (and in CI) — it's fast and needs no agent.
python3.12 run.py --check

# golden self-test: run each T1 scenario's reference commands, grade the lab.
# Every T1 scenario must PASS here — this validates the fixtures + grader.
python3.12 run.py --all --reference

# grade one lab by hand
python3.12 graders/t1_config.py /path/to/lab.toml scenarios/c1_provision_target.toml
```

## Running a real agent

`run.py` drives `claude` headless (`claude -p`, prompt on stdin) in a sandbox:

```bash
# config scenario, agent must discover + use paniolo from cold:
python3.12 run.py --scenario c1 --condition cold --agent claude --isolation home

# runtime scenario, warm condition, with an LLM judge:
python3.12 run.py --scenario r1 --condition warm --agent claude --judge-cmd "claude -p"
```

**Other agents.** `--agent agy` drives the `agy` CLI (`agy -p "<goal>"`; it takes
the prompt as the flag argument, and runs shell tools headlessly without a skip
flag). Two caveats: agy re-derives `PATH` for its shell tool, so it **bypasses
the logging shim** — the `lab.toml` outcome is still graded, but the T1-safe
allowlist check is not enforced for agy; and use `--isolation light` (a sandbox
`HOME` breaks agy's own auth). The `--judge-cmd` path currently assumes a
stdin-reading judge (works with `claude -p`), so T0 judging isn't wired for
`agy -p` (prompt-as-argument) yet.

The runner, per scenario:
1. makes a temp sandbox: throwaway `lab.toml`, a `paniolo` **shim** that logs
   every invoked argv (for the T1-safe allowlist check) then execs the real CLI,
   and per-condition skill state;
2. runs the reference commands or the agent (goal piped on stdin, `cwd` = sandbox
   project dir, `PANIOLO_LAB` = sandbox lab);
3. grades: `t1_config` for T1, the judge prompt for T0;
4. writes a summary to `results/` and leaves the sandbox for inspection on
   failure.

### Discovery conditions (`--condition`)

| Condition | How it's realized | Tests |
|---|---|---|
| `cold` | nothing pushed; the agent must pull guidance via `paniolo --help`/`paniolo skill` | the self-describing surface |
| `warm` | the `paniolo` skill is copied into the sandbox `cwd`'s `.claude/skills/` so it's registered | the "invoke the skill" decision + usage |
| `preloaded` | the full `SKILL.md` is injected with `--append-system-prompt` | usage only (ceiling) |

### ⚠️ Run a clean agent

Results are only meaningful if the agent doesn't already know paniolo from its
environment. The maintainer's own machine is the most contaminated possible
(user `CLAUDE.md`, auto-memory naming paniolo + bench hosts, prior sessions).
Use `--isolation home` to run with a sandbox `HOME` (no user `CLAUDE.md`/memory).
`--isolation light` (default) keeps your `HOME` for auth and only skips user
*settings* — fine for smoke-testing the harness, **not** for real Cold numbers
(your user memory loads, and if it names paniolo the agent isn't naive).

**Auth under `home` isolation.** The runner copies `~/.claude/.credentials.json`
into the sandbox `HOME`, but on a macOS setup that authenticates via the
**Keychain** that file can be stale — the agent then dies with
`401 Invalid authentication credentials` and runs nothing. If you hit that,
either export a valid `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` (it's passed through to the agent) or
mint a fresh token into the sandbox home before the run. See
`docs/agent-evals.md` §3.1 and §8.

## Serial — the operating workhorse

Driving the serial console is most of how agents use paniolo, so it has a
dedicated cluster (`s1`–`s10`): `s1` is config (T1, scripted); `s2`–`s10` are
*operating* scenarios — start capture, tail, poll new output with `--since`,
send a command and read its response, pace a slow polled console, pick one of
two interfaces with `-i`, re-read an exact `--from/--to --json` range, port
exclusivity, DTR reset/hard-off, and read-back-after-stop.

The operating scenarios are judge-graded as stated commands by default (they
need a real port). The ones with a `[loopback]` table (marked `exec` in
`--list`) can also be **executed for real on Linux** via `serial_loopback.py`,
which opens a PTY, plays a fake DUT on the far end (banner + command responses),
drives `serial watch`/`send`/`log`, and asserts on the captured log:

```bash
python3.12 serial_loopback.py            # all exec serial scenarios
python3.12 serial_loopback.py s4 s2      # by id
```

> **macOS can't run these.** serialcap's `serialport`-crate open issues a
> serial-only ioctl that BSD ptys reject with ENOTTY ("Not a typewriter") —
> verified directly — so on macOS every loopback scenario reports **SKIP**, not
> FAIL. Run the harness on a Linux control host or in CI. (The Linux path is
> designed but unverified from the macOS dev box.)

## Adding a scenario

Drop a `scenarios/<id>.toml` (see any existing one). T1 scenarios set
`grader.type = "t1_config"` with `[[grader.assert]]` blocks (path + one of
`equals`/`contains`/`matches`/`exists`); path syntax supports
`targets.x.serial[name=bmc].baud`. Keep the `reference` list executable for T1
(it's the golden self-test) and descriptive for T0. Keep references in sync with
the CLI surface — they're the judge's source of truth. Run `python3.12 run.py
--check` after editing: it validates every `paniolo …` reference line (subcommand
paths + flags) and the T1-safe allowlist against the live `--help` tree. It skips
multi-line prose references (m1/m2/s8-style) and honors shell quoting and
pass-through args (`helper <name> …`), so only genuine drift trips it.
