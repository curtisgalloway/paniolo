"""LLM-as-judge grader for T0 (stated-command) and meta scenarios.

This module builds the judge prompt from a scenario + the agent transcript.
It does not hard-code a model client: pass a `judge_cmd` (e.g. "claude -p")
to `run_judge` and it pipes the prompt in and parses the JSON verdict back.
With no judge_cmd, callers just persist the prompt for manual/automated
grading. See docs/agent-evals.md sec. 6.2.

Score each dimension 0, 1, or 2 with a one-sentence justification that QUOTES
the transcript:
  D1 discovery        consulted an authoritative source (paniolo --help / skill /
                      docs) fitting the goal before acting   [N/A under preloaded]
  D2 right_capability chose the correct subsystem/command
  D3 command_form     correct subcommand, flags, -t/positional convention
  D4 invent_resist    used ONLY real commands/flags  [HARD-FAIL]
  D5 gotcha_aware     respected the scenario's documented trap(s)
  D6 goal_achieved    the stated sequence would achieve the goal
  D7 efficiency       few/no wrong turns or redundant help reads  [soft]

Hard-fail rule: set hard_fail=true and pass=false if D4 is 0 -- i.e. the agent
ran or recommended a command or flag that does NOT exist in paniolo. Judge D4
*strictly against the COMMAND REFERENCE below* -- that is the real CLI surface.
A command, subcommand, or flag present in (or consistent with) the reference is
REAL: this includes top-level commands like `power-cycle`, `console`,
`power-state`; channel verbs like `video watch`, `hid serve`; and short-flag
aliases / abbreviations (e.g. `-o` for `--out`). Do NOT flag something as
invented just because the scenario's REFERENCE used a different command -- check
the COMMAND REFERENCE. Only hard-fail when a command/flag is clearly absent from
and inconsistent with the reference.

Trap accountability (drives D5): evaluate EACH trap listed under TRAPS PROBED
separately. For each, decide respected=true/false and quote the transcript line
that shows it. D5 is 2 only if every trap is respected, 1 if a minor trap is
missed, 0 if a central trap is walked into. Report this as `traps_eval`.

PASS RULE (apply mechanically, do not eyeball): pass=true iff ALL hold --
  (a) hard_fail is false;
  (b) D2, D3, and D6 are each >= 1 (right capability, well-formed, would work);
  (c) no central trap was walked into (the corresponding traps_eval entry is
      respected=false on a trap the scenario calls central);
  (d) the weighted total is >= 0.75 of max, where weighted = d1+d2+d3+d6 plus
      2*d4 (invention weighted double) plus d5, with d7 excluded (soft); max is
      2*(1+1+1+1+2+1) = 16, so the threshold is >= 12.
Under `preloaded`, omit d1 from both the weighted sum and the max (max 14,
threshold >= 10.5 -> 11)."""

You are grading whether a coding agent correctly DISCOVERED and USED the
`paniolo` CLI to accomplish a user's goal. paniolo controls a physical target
machine (netboot, serial console, HDMI capture + OCR, power, USB HID, adb).
You are given the goal, a REFERENCE approach an expert would take, the TRAPS
this scenario probes, the discovery CONDITION, the real COMMAND REFERENCE, and
the agent's full TRANSCRIPT.
