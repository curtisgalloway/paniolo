"""Scoring, and the two shapes of ground truth.

`<stem>.gt.txt` is a full transcription, scored by CER and WER. `<stem>.gt.json`
carries `required_tokens` — the strings paniolo actually has to find on that
screen — scored by recall.

The second form exists because full transcription of a busy GUI frame is
expensive and mostly measures things nobody cares about (window chrome, clock
digits, a wallpaper's stray glyphs). What matters for a bring-up tool is whether
`UEFI: PXE IPv4` and `KINGSTON` came back, and token recall says exactly that.

**Recall is scored against normalized text, but reported alongside which tokens
were missed**, because *which* ones vanish is the finding. An engine that drops
every boot-order value while reading the page heading perfectly is not 80%
correct in any sense an agent cares about.
