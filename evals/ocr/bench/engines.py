"""OCR engines, behind one adapter.

**The adapter is paniolo's v1 OCR envelope** (`docs/ocr.md`), not a Python
protocol invented here. That is a deliberate departure from the original
benchmark plan, and the reason is that the envelope arrived in the meantime: it
already carries text, per-line confidence, bounding boxes and engine identity in
a uniform shape, and it is what paniolo *actually runs in production*. A harness
that scored Python library calls instead would be measuring something adjacent
to the thing being shipped.

So there are two kinds of engine:

- `HelperEngine` runs an installed paniolo helper (`visionocr`, `winocr`,
  `linuxocr`) with `--json`. This is the deployed path, byte for byte.
- `RapidOcrEngine` wraps a *candidate* that paniolo does not ship yet, and
  produces the same envelope.

The point of the second shape is that a candidate which wins can be promoted to
a helper binary with no change to anything that scores it — and that a candidate
which loses costs nothing to remove. All RapidOCR-specific imports stay inside
its class: it is a thin wrapper around models from upstream PaddleOCR with a
single-maintainer bus factor, so the replacement path (a direct ONNX Runtime
pipeline over the same models) must stay a one-file change.
