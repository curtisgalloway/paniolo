# OCR benchmark

Scores paniolo's OCR helpers against real dongle captures, so the production
config per screen type is chosen from numbers rather than impressions.

```sh
uv sync
uv run python -m bench.runner                        # everything
uv run python -m bench.runner --limit 2 --repeats 1  # smoke test
uv run python -m bench.runner --engines visionocr,linuxocr --variants raw,luma_up2
```

Results land in `results/` (gitignored): `raw.csv`, one row per
(image × engine × variant), and `summary.md`, which is meant to be sufficient on
its own to pick a config.

## The adapter is paniolo's OCR envelope

Engines are driven through the **v1 envelope** (`docs/dev/ocr.md`) rather than a
Python protocol invented here. That is a departure from the plan this harness
was specced from, and the reason is that the envelope arrived in between: it
already carries text, per-line confidence, boxes and engine identity in one
shape, and it is what paniolo actually runs. Scoring Python library calls would
measure something adjacent to what ships.

So `HelperEngine` runs an installed helper (`visionocr`, `winocr`, `linuxocr`)
exactly as hdmicap does — `--json`, PNG on stdin. A candidate paniolo does not
ship yet, like RapidOCR/PP-OCRv5, implements the same envelope in Python
(`RapidOcrEngine`). A candidate that wins can then be promoted to a helper
binary without changing anything that scores it.

**Put the helpers on `$PATH` before running**, and check `engine_detail` in
`raw.csv` afterwards. A stale binary is the easiest way to get confident, wrong
numbers — the first real run here silently measured an old `visionocr` whose
default was `.fast`, and `engine_detail` is what caught it.

## Ground truth

Beside each image: `<stem>.gt.txt` (full transcription, scored by CER and WER)
or `<stem>.gt.json` with `required_tokens` (scored by recall).

Token recall exists because transcribing a busy GUI frame in full is expensive
and mostly scores things nobody needs — window chrome, a clock, wallpaper
noise. What matters is whether `UEFI: PXE IPv4` and `KINGSTON` came back. The
report lists **which** tokens were missed, because that is the finding: an
engine that reads a BIOS page's headings and drops every boot-order value
scores respectably and cannot do the job.

**Ground truth is transcribed by eye, never from an engine's output.** Deriving
it from OCR would measure agreement with itself.

Coverage is currently **3 of 13 frames**, and two of those three are the
near-identical boot-priority pair — so treat the "recommended config" lines as
provisional. Extending coverage is the highest-value work left here.

## What the numbers say so far

Ground truth on 6 GUI and 2 text frames. The two screen types behave
**differently**, which is the two-mode split the research predicted — but not
quite in the shape it predicted.

GUI screens (token-recall error, lower is better):

| engine | best variant | error |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `visionocr` (`.accurate`) | `luma_up2_nn` | **0.062** |
| `linuxocr` (Tesseract) | `luma_up2_nn` | 0.312 |
| `visionocr --fast` | `luma_up2` | 0.583 |

Text screens (CER, lower is better):

| engine | best variant | error |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `visionocr` (`.accurate`) | `luma_up3_inv` | **0.016** |
| `linuxocr` (Tesseract) | `luma_up2_otsu` | 0.019 |
| `visionocr --fast` | `luma_up3_inv` | 0.053 |

**Vision beats Tesseract about 5x on GUI screens and roughly ties it on text.**
That is the practical finding: Tesseract is not a weak engine, it is a weak
engine *on anti-aliased UI text*. Which means on Linux — where Vision does not
exist and Tesseract is the default — the gap is GUI screens specifically, and
that is exactly where the researched candidate (RapidOCR/PP-OCRv5) would earn
its place. On macOS no routing is needed: Vision wins or ties both types.

The best preprocessing *variant* also differs by type (`luma_up2_nn` for GUI,
`luma_up3_inv` for text), though the spread between variants is much smaller
than the spread between engines.

### Hallucination is measurable, and recall alone will not show it

`gui-pi-desktop-tooltip.png` has three real strings on a photographic gradient.
Reading `lines` next to `recall`:

| engine | lines emitted | recall |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `visionocr` | 2 | 0.67 |
| `visionocr --fast` | 2 | **0.00** |
| `linuxocr` | 5 | 0.33 |

`--fast` emitted two lines and got *none* of the real text: pure invention.
Tesseract emitted five lines where three exist. A recall score alone would rank
the second and third of those as merely mediocre rather than as making things
up, which for an agent acting on the output is a different kind of wrong.

### What even the best config still misses

`-rw-r--r--`, `11:52 AM`, `Wastebasket` — a permission string, a clock, an icon
label. Permission strings are the interesting one: they differ from their
neighbours by single characters in a fixed context, which is where an engine
that smooths glyphs together fails and where a diff-based agent check would too.

## A question this harness cannot answer

`pipeline_luma_direct` and `pipeline_rgb_roundtrip` exist to test whether
paniolo's capture path costs OCR quality: on macOS and Windows a frame is NV12,
so the Y plane *is* the greyscale image OCR wants, yet `/ocr` converts to RGB,
encodes PNG, and the helper decodes and re-greyscales it.

**The two variants score identically here, and that result is not meaningful.**
The dataset is saved PNGs, so the RGB conversion already happened upstream —
both variants start from the same RGB image and neither has the original luma.
The harness is measuring a round trip applied *on top of* a round trip.

Answering it properly needs frames captured as NV12 and as PNG from the *same*
device frame, which is a change to the capture path, not to this harness. Until
then, do not read the tie as evidence that the pipeline is harmless.

## Running on a Pi

The engine choice for Linux is the reason this exists, and a Pi 4B under
sustained neural OCR thermally throttles — which looks exactly like a slow
engine. The runner records the device-tree model, CPU governor and throttle
state, samples temperature around each engine's block, and flags any run where
the throttle bits changed. Prefer the `performance` governor, run nothing else,
and copy the dataset to local storage first: image I/O jitter off a network
mount lands directly in the latency column.
