# OCR benchmark frames

13 frames captured through the real dongle path on the CI rack — never
host-side screenshots, never resized, never re-encoded. `MANIFEST.md` (written
by the session that captured them) has the per-file table, target, and
negotiated capture format.

Two properties of this set are worth preserving if it is ever regenerated.

**It contains a genuine MJPEG-vs-raw A/B.** The two NanoKVM-USB units
negotiated MJPEG 1280x720, so those frames carry in-dongle JPEG 4:2:0 artifacts
baked in before hdmicap saw them; the Pi's KVM-USB v2 negotiated YUYV 4:2:2 with
no JPEG stage. Near-identical content on both sides of that split is what lets
the benchmark separate "engine is bad at this" from "the capture destroyed it".
The format is **negotiated, not a device property** — all three dongles offer
both at 1280x720 — so re-check with `v4l2-ctl --get-fmt-video` before drawing
conclusions from any frame captured later.

**Every frame was kept and de-duplicated by hash, not filtered by signal.**
That is not fastidiousness; see below.

## Do not gate captures on `signal`

hdmicap's `signal` field is unreliable in **both** directions, so a collector
that skips `no_signal` shots loses real frames and one that trusts `stable`
records fictional ones.

`text-nuc-pxe-gigaboot-start.png` is a clean, fully readable frame that hdmicap
labelled `no_signal`. It reproduces deterministically from the committed file:
`frame::classify` samples a 32x32 lattice (`GRID = 8 * CELL_SAMPLES`) and calls
a frame blank when `mean < 10 && var < 64`. On that frame the lattice reports
`mean=0, var=0` — **1024 samples, not one of which lands on a glyph**, though
1.35% of the frame is at luma 255.

That is the shape of every boot screen: sparse bright text on black. Measured
over this set, every TEXT frame has mean luma <= 2, and three of the four clear
the threshold only on variance. The classifier is not detecting "no signal", it
is detecting "mostly black" — and mostly-black is what firmware, bootloaders and
consoles look like, which is the screen type paniolo exists to read.

Sampling density is the whole story:

| lattice | samples | max luma seen | samples on text |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 32x32 (current) | 1024 | 20 | 0 |
| 64x64 | 4096 | 255 | 42 |

Separately, a stale frame can retain `signal: stable` indefinitely: on a capture
error `capture_thread` does `continue` without publishing, so the last
`FrameState` stays in the watch channel with its old label. Two independent
sightings, one across a mode change and one where a power-cut machine kept
reporting `stable` on its pre-cut desktop.

**So: save every frame, de-duplicate by content hash afterwards, and treat
`signal` as a hint.** The best frame in the second batch would have been thrown
away by a collector that trusted it.

## Ground truth

Not yet written. Text frames get `<stem>.gt.txt` (literal expected text, reading
order); busy GUI frames get `<stem>.gt.json` with `required_tokens` — the
strings paniolo actually needs to find — scored by recall rather than CER.
