# Puppeting a GUI through a KVM-like interface

You have **eyes and hands on a separate physical computer** (the *target*)
through paniolo's `video` and `hid` channels. The target's screen arrives as a
captured image (`paniolo video`); your keystrokes and mouse events go out
through an emulated USB keyboard/mouse (`paniolo hid`), so the target sees
ordinary HID input. This works on any target with HDMI + USB — any OS, an
installer, the BIOS, a machine you may not install software on.

There is **no element tree, no DOM, and no accessibility API** — only pixels and
HID events. There is no undo and no dry-run: the target is a real machine and
every keystroke and click has real consequences. Work accordingly.

This skill is the *doctrine* — how to think and what loop to run. For the
command surface (channel setup, every `video`/`hid` flag, the lab file, remote
hosts) see the **`paniolo`** skill; this skill assumes the target already has
working `video` and `hid` channels.

## Hardware is irrelevant to the method

Two injectors are common and both speak the same `paniolo hid` commands:

- an **Openterface Mini-KVM** (one box: an MS2109 HDMI capture + a CH9329 HID
  bridge, driven by the `ch9329` helper), or
- a **capture dongle + a KB2040** injector (the `hidrig` helper).

The doctrine below is identical for either. A couple of CH9329-only conveniences
are noted where relevant (`hid send info` reports target-USB enumeration; `hid
send baud` persistently changes the link rate).

## Orient before you touch anything (once per session)

1. Start the capture daemon and warm the hid daemon (see *Warm the daemon*):

   ```sh
   paniolo video watch <target>      # start the HDMI capture daemon
   paniolo hid serve   <target>      # warm the hid daemon (idempotent)
   paniolo hid send -t <target> ping # confirm the injector answers
   ```

2. **Take one screenshot and view it before doing anything else.**

   ```sh
   paniolo video shot <target> -o screen.png    # prints "signal=… hash=H" on stderr
   ```

   Confirm the image shows the machine you were asked to operate. **If you
   cannot identify the target from its screen, stop and ask** — typing or
   clicking into the wrong machine is the worst failure this tool has.

3. Note the screenshot's **pixel dimensions** (e.g. 1920×1080). The capture
   tracks the target's video mode, so these are the screen size you scale mouse
   coordinates against (see *Clicking accurately*). Re-check them if the target
   changes resolution (login → desktop, a mode switch, a reboot).

## The loop: look → act → settle → verify

Every interaction is the same cycle. Treat it as non-negotiable while you are
learning a UI.

```sh
paniolo video shot <target> -o screen.png            # 1. look — then VIEW the image
paniolo hid send  -t <target> combo LEFT_ALT F       # 2. act (one small action)
paniolo video shot <target> --changed-since H \
        --timeout 5000 -o screen.png                 # 3. settle — block until pixels change
                                                     # 4. verify — VIEW the saved frame
```

(`H` is the `hash=` value the previous `shot` printed on stderr.)

Rules that keep the loop honest:

- **Never act on a stale screenshot.** If anything has happened since your last
  capture — including your own previous action — capture again first.
- **One action per cycle** while exploring a UI. Batch actions only after the
  exact sequence has worked before (a known menu path).
- **Never assume an action landed.** Act, settle, look, and only then decide the
  next step. If the screen did not change, your action probably missed — re-read
  the screen rather than repeating harder.
- `--changed-since` exits non-zero on timeout. A timeout after an action that
  *should* have a visible effect is a signal, not an inconvenience.
- For slow targets (loading dialogs, device scans, installs) poll with repeated
  `--changed-since … --timeout 30000` rather than fixed sleeps.

## Warm the daemon for multi-step work

Each bare `paniolo hid send` is a fresh process. With the **hid daemon** running
(`paniolo hid serve <target>`, or `paniolo console <target>`, which auto-starts
it), every injection flows through one long-lived connection that owns the
injector. This matters because the daemon is what makes **held state survive
across commands**:

- `down`/`up` and `mdown`/`mup` (holding a modifier or button across several
  later commands), and click-and-drag, only compose reliably *through the
  daemon* — its one session carries the in-flight HID report. Without it, a
  held key may be released when the next process starts.
- The CLI and the browser KVM (`paniolo console`) intermix cleanly, because the
  daemon serializes everyone's commands onto the one wire.

So: for anything beyond a single tap/click, **warm the daemon first**. A single
`combo` or a `run` sequence is self-contained and works either way.

## Keyboard first, mouse second

Vision-guided clicking is the least reliable primitive you have. Prefer, in
order:

1. **Keyboard shortcuts** — `paniolo hid send combo LEFT_CONTROL S`,
   `paniolo hid send key F5`.
2. **Menu accelerators** — on Windows, tap `LEFT_ALT` to reveal the underlined
   letters, then the letter: `hid send key LEFT_ALT` then `hid send key F` then
   `hid send key O` for File→Open.
3. **Tab/arrow navigation** — `hid send key TAB`, `hid send key ENTER` walks a
   dialog; arrows move within lists and menus.
4. **Type the path instead of browsing** — in any file dialog, focus the path
   field and type the full path rather than clicking through folders.
5. **Mouse clicks** — only when no keyboard route exists.

Key names are **`adafruit_hid` Keycode names**, not `ctrl+s`-style chords:
`A`–`Z`, `ENTER`, `TAB`, `SPACE`, `ESCAPE`, `BACKSPACE`, `DELETE`, `UP_ARROW`/
`DOWN_ARROW`/`LEFT_ARROW`/`RIGHT_ARROW`, `LEFT_CONTROL`/`LEFT_ALT`/`LEFT_SHIFT`/
`LEFT_GUI` (and `RIGHT_*`), `F1`–`F12`, `FORWARD_SLASH`, `MINUS`, etc. `combo`
presses all named keys together then releases them: `combo LEFT_CONTROL LEFT_ALT
DELETE`.

## Clicking accurately — scale pixels to the logical space

This is the one mechanic everyone gets wrong. **`moveabs` does not take
screenshot pixels.** It takes an absolute position in a `0..32767` logical space
on each axis, which the target OS maps across the full screen. You must scale
your measured pixel against the screenshot's own dimensions:

```
logical_x = round(pixel_x * 32767 / screen_width)
logical_y = round(pixel_y * 32767 / screen_height)
```

Example — click a button whose center is at pixel `(412, 309)` on a 1920×1080
capture:

```sh
# 412*32767/1920 = 7031 ; 309*32767/1080 = 9375
paniolo hid send -t <target> moveabs 7031 9375
paniolo hid send -t <target> click left
```

- Use the screenshot's **native** pixel size. If you viewed it downscaled,
  convert your measured coordinates back to native pixels first.
- Aim at the **center** of a control, not its edge or its text baseline.
- For small/dense targets (toolbar icons, tree expanders, checkboxes), **crop
  and zoom** the screenshot file locally to measure the center precisely (e.g.
  `magick screen.png -crop 400x300+800+200 zoom.png`), then translate offsets
  back to full-image coordinates.
- After a precision click, **verify the intended control responded** (a
  highlight, a dialog, a state change) — not merely that *something* changed.
- `moveabs` then a screenshot (no click) shows hover state and tooltips — useful
  to confirm you are over the right control before committing to the click.
- Right-click is `click right`; double-click is two `click left` in quick
  succession (warm the daemon so they are not split across processes).

If a click consistently lands a little off, your `screen_width`/`screen_height`
is stale (the target changed resolution) — re-screenshot and re-read its size
before adjusting anything else.

## Read the screen with OCR

You do not have to eyeball every pixel. `paniolo video read <target>` runs OCR
on the current frame and prints the text — use it to confirm a window title, a
button label, an error message, or which screen you are on, and to locate text
you then translate to a click. It reads large UI text well; very small console
or status-bar fonts may produce a few character confusions (`1`/`l`, `O`/`0`),
so verify critical strings against a screenshot.

## Typing

- `paniolo hid send type "some text"` types a string. It assumes a **US
  keyboard layout** on the target; if output looks transposed, the target's
  layout differs — tell the user rather than guessing.
- **Verify focus before typing anything that matters.** Click the field, settle,
  screenshot, and confirm the caret/highlight is where you expect — text typed
  into the wrong field (or a defocused window) goes nowhere good.
- Press `ENTER` as a separate `key ENTER` only when you intend to submit; check
  the typed text in a screenshot *before* committing it.

## Safety on a real machine

- Treat destructive UI (Delete, Format, "Don't Save", firmware/boot menus,
  partition tools) with the same caution as destructive shell commands:
  screenshot first, and confirm with the user unless already authorized.
- A stray `key LEFT_GUI` or misplaced click can change target state. If you get
  lost: screenshot, `key ESCAPE`, settle, re-orient — do not click blindly to
  recover.
- If the screen shows a login prompt, lock screen, UAC/credential dialog, or
  anything you were not told to expect, **stop and ask** rather than entering
  guessed credentials or dismissing it.
- When you are done, leave the target in a sane state (close what you opened,
  release any held keys with `paniolo hid send releaseall`).

## Troubleshooting

| symptom | likely cause / fix |
|---|---|
| screenshot is black / "no signal" | target asleep or not driving video; wake it (`hid send key LEFT_SHIFT`, or move the mouse) and re-shoot |
| `video shot` errors / no frame | capture daemon not running — `paniolo video watch <target>` first (or `paniolo console`) |
| clicks land offset | wrong screen size in the scaling — re-screenshot, use its native pixel dimensions; the capture tracks the target's current mode |
| click seems ignored | scale was off (clicked empty space), or a multi-step interaction split across processes — warm the daemon (`paniolo hid serve`) and retry |
| `moveabs` didn't move the cursor where expected | you passed pixels, not logical `0..32767` — apply the scaling formula |
| held modifier/drag doesn't work | one-shot processes don't carry held state — run through the daemon |
| typed text garbled / wrong characters | non-US layout on the target, or you typed into a defocused window — click the field and confirm the caret first |
| injector doesn't respond (`ping` fails) | target (which powers the injector) is off, or the hid channel's device/cmd is wrong — see the `paniolo` skill's `hid`/`doctor` |
| CH9329: target sees no input though `ping` works | the target hasn't enumerated the emulated HID — check `paniolo hid send info` (`target_connected`); re-seat the target USB cable |
