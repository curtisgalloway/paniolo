# HID injector host tools (macOS)

Tools for testing the KB2040 injector (an RP2040 board acting as a USB keyboard
and mouse) with its USB plugged into the **same Mac** that drives the control
link.

Build the C/Objective-C tools:

```bash
make            # builds hid_capture_usb and hid_seize_reports
```

The Python tools run under `uv`; no build step.

| Tool | Use it for | Works with |
|---|---|---|
| `hid_capture_usb` | Leak-safe capture of the injector's reports (use this one) | Either firmware |
| `hid_seize_reports` | Passive timestamped tap; **not** exclusive | Either firmware |
| `hid_bench.py` | Latency and throughput | Retired single-board firmware only |
| `leak_check.py` | Assert that injection does not move the real cursor | Retired single-board firmware only |

The two C tools observe the DUT-facing HID board, which has the same VID/PID on
both firmwares.

## hid_capture_usb — leak-safe HID capture

**Always start this tool before injecting**, or the reports leak into your live
session.

It detaches the injector from macOS with IOUSBHost whole-device capture
(`IOUSBHostObjectInitOptionsDeviceCapture`; root passes the same gate as the
`com.apple.vm.device-access` entitlement) and prints each interrupt-IN report
with timestamps. Injected input reaches **only** this tool.

```bash
sudo ./hid_capture_usb            # defaults to the injector serial
sudo ./hid_capture_usb <serial>   # there may be >1 KB2040 (same VID/PID) attached
HID_CAPTURE_PROBE=1 sudo -E ./hid_capture_usb   # hold the capture and sleep, for hidutil/leak inspection
```

Each line is `report ts=<sec.usec> dt=<usec-since-prev> len=<n>: <hex>`. The
first payload byte is the report ID (1 = keyboard, 2 = absolute mouse). While
it runs, the injector is absent from `hidutil list`.

## hid_seize_reports — passive raw-report tap (NOT exclusive)

Uses `IOHIDDeviceOpen(..., kIOHIDOptionsTypeSeizeDevice)`, which on Darwin
24/25 is **not** exclusive: injected mouse moves still move the real cursor.
Use it only as a passive tap. Requires `sudo` plus an Input Monitoring grant in
System Settings.

## hid_bench.py — latency / throughput (retired single-board path)

> **Note:** `hid_bench.py` and `leak_check.py` speak only the retired
> single-board firmware's line protocol over a USB-serial adapter (`OK`/`ERR`
> replies, 115200→460800 baud negotiation). They cannot drive the dual-board
> rig's USB-CDC binary-frame link. The retired firmware is paniolo-hardware
> `hidrig-kb2040/firmware/single-board/{boot,code,config}.py`
> (https://github.com/curtisgalloway/paniolo-hardware).

It times command round trips over the UART (setting `IOSSDATALAT` itself).
Start `hid_capture_usb` first.

```bash
uv run --with pyserial hid_bench.py --device /dev/cu.usbserial-XXXX \
    --baud 460800 --latency-us 1 --mode latency --count 100
```

| Mode | Measures |
|---|---|
| `latency` | per-sample cmd→OK round trip + percentiles |
| `rr` | back-to-back request/reply rate |
| `pipe` | windowed pipelining |

`--latency-us` sets the macOS serial read-latency timer (1 ≈ floor; 0 leaves
the default). Typical: `ping` ~3 ms, `moveabs` ~8 ms (USB `bInterval` floor),
~123 moveabs/s.

## leak_check.py — assert no leak (retired single-board path)

Injects one centered `moveabs` and checks whether the real cursor moved. Expect `NO LEAK` while `hid_capture_usb` holds the device.

```bash
uv run --with pyserial --with pyobjc-framework-Quartz leak_check.py \
    --device /dev/cu.usbserial-XXXX
```
