# Paniolo — Requirements & progress tracker

> Project-wide requirements for **paniolo**, an agent-controlled target-machine wrangler for
> low-level software development (bootloaders, firmware, OS bring-up). This is the single
> source of truth for *what paniolo must do* and *how far along each capability is* — covering
> both shipped capabilities and planned work.
>
> Scope note: paniolo is a **device-control / "wrangling" layer** (power, serial, deploy/netboot,
> video, HID). It deliberately does **not** own test orchestration or result production — when
> integrated with hardware-CI ecosystems, those stay above paniolo (see §9).
>
> Companion design docs live under [`docs/ci-integration/`](ci-integration/) (gap analysis +
> integration design) and per-feature docs under [`docs/`](.). **Update the Status column as
> work lands.**

> Last updated: 2026-05-29.

## 1. Foundations / platform

| ID | Requirement | Pri | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| CORE-1 | Per-target config in `~/.config/paniolo/targets/<name>.toml`; one file per target, no daemon required | M | ☑ | `_config.py`; single target is the default |
| CORE-2 | CLI (`paniolo`) over subcommands; SSH-drivable from a dev machine into the control host | M | ☑ | Remote-control pattern (README) |

## 3. Serial console

| ID | Requirement | Pri | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|

## 8. Cross-cutting / non-functional

| ID | Requirement | Pri | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| NF-1 | Interactive/agent bring-up workflow (dashboard, OCR, HID, `tio`, JSONL) never regresses | M | ◐ | Regression guard on every change, esp. §9 serial work |
| NF-2 | Changes land as smallest reversible steps, each with tests | M | ◐ | |
| NF-3 | Core power/serial path stays functional on both macOS and Linux | M | ☑ | CI-only features may be Linux-only (see §9) |
| NF-4 | External contracts re-verified against upstream before relying on them | M | ◐ | re-check Fuchsia `device.go` (FX-4) |

---

## 9. Hardware-CI integration (KernelCI/LAVA + Fuchsia/botanist)

> Goal: make paniolo's primitives **consumable by** LAVA (under KernelCI's Maestro) and
> `botanist`+`testrunner` (under Fuchsia/LUCI) — *without* paniolo owning orchestration or
> results. Full analysis: [`ci-integration/gap-analysis.md`](ci-integration/gap-analysis.md);
> design: [`ci-integration/design.md`](ci-integration/design.md).
>
> **Current focus:** the owner is doing a **Fuchsia port** with an agent — single user, no
> existing users, breaking changes are free. M1 leads with the Fuchsia-critical path (PTY +
> power); the botanist adapter is sequenced before LAVA.

### 9.0 Decisions (locked 2026-05-29)

| ID | Decision | Resolution |
|---|---|---|
| D-1 | KCIDB results path | ⊘ Out of scope — LAVA-lab path only for KernelCI |
| D-2 | Fuchsia serial ownership | PTY proxy; paniolo keeps the physical port (JSONL/dashboard stay live) |
| D-3 | Serial write arbitration | Cooperative last-writer-wins + advisory lock in `/status` + opt-in `--exclusive`, **auto-released on client disconnect** (+ optional `--lock-timeout`) |
| D-4 | JTAG in v1 | Extension point only (schema + verb stubs); OpenOCD backend deferred |
| D-5 | CI control-host OS | Linux-only for CI; macOS stays first-class for interactive bring-up |
| D-6 | Deploy ownership in CI | Orchestrator owns deploy (LAVA TFTP / botanist pave); paniolo netboot stands down |
| D-7 | Serial TCP endpoint | Native Rust TCP listener in serialcap; ser2net-on-PTY as LAVA fallback |
| D-8 | `[power]` config | Breaking change accepted — clean `[power]` block, no `power_cycle_cmd` alias; update `AGENTS.md` |

### 9.1 Agnostic device-control API — Power

| ID | Requirement | Source | Pri | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| PWR-1 | `paniolo power on` — applies power; DUT begins booting unattended | LAVA | M | ☑ | `on_cmd` hook (2026-06-04) |
| PWR-2 | `paniolo power off` — cuts power | LAVA | M | ☑ | `off_cmd` hook (2026-06-04) |
| PWR-3 | `paniolo power reset` — off+delay+on (hard reset) | LAVA | M | ☐ | verb is still `power-cycle`; the `cambrionix` helper's `cycle` does off+delay+on |
| PWR-4 | `paniolo power state` — read on/off | BOTH | M | ☑ | `power-state`, now `state_cmd`-backed when configured; rename only |
| PWR-5 | `[power]` config block w/ `backend = script\|dtr\|pdu\|jtag` + on/off/reset cmds | BOTH | M | ☑ | landed 2026-06-04 as generic hooks (`cycle/on/off/state_cmd`) — no backend enum; device-specific logic lives in helper binaries |
| PWR-6 | Power commands usable as plain shell cmds (string or list) from a generator | LAVA | M | ☑ | hooks are plain `sh -c` strings |
| PWR-7 | Update `AGENTS.md` for the new `[power]` config + verbs | OWNER | M | ☑ | done with the hooks change |

### 9.2 Agnostic device-control API — Serial (core gap)

| ID | Requirement | Source | Pri | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| SER-1 | serialcap exposes a **raw bidirectional TCP listener** (ser2net-equivalent) | LAVA | M | ☐ | backs `connection_command = telnet host port` |
| SER-2 | serialcap exposes a **PTY** whose slave path is a real device file | FX | M | ☐ | handed to botanist as `DeviceConfig.serial` |
| SER-3 | New endpoints **tee off the existing supervisor** (JSONL/WS/dashboard unaffected) | OWNER | M | ☐ | preserves NF-1 |
| SER-4 | `paniolo serial send <bytes\|->` one-shot write (agent feature) | OWNER | M | ☐ | same `write_tx` channel; `--enter`/`--hex`/stdin |
| SER-5 | Write arbitration per D-3 (lock, `/status` holder, `--exclusive`, auto-release) | OWNER | M | ☐ | |
| SER-6 | Stable socket/PTY paths under `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/paniolo/<target>/` | BOTH | S | ☐ | predictable for adapters |
| SER-7 | Existing JSONL log, `/stream`, `tio`, `serial log/dtr/reset` unchanged | OWNER | M | ☐ | regression guard / tests |

### 9.3 Agnostic device-control API — Deploy / boot / debug

| ID | Requirement | Source | Pri | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| DEP-1 | netboot **stands down** under CI; no DHCP/TFTP contention | BOTH | M | ☐ | guard `netboot start` when CI attach active |
| DEP-2 | netboot remains available for interactive/non-CI use | OWNER | M | ☑ | exists (NET-1..4); just not the CI path |
| DEP-3 | (Full) paniolo-serves-images as a non-standard LAVA deploy method | LAVA | C | ⤵ | only if a board can't use LAVA TFTP |
| BOOT-1 | `paniolo serial wait --match <regex> [--timeout]` boot-detect helper | OWNER | S | ⤵ | not required by either orchestrator; ergonomics |
| JTAG-1 | `[jtag]`/`[debug]` config schema + `paniolo debug {halt\|resume\|reset\|gdb}` stubs | OWNER | C | ☐ | extension point only per D-4 |
| JTAG-2 | OpenOCD backend: reset, flash-deploy, GDB `:3333` / Tcl `:6666` sockets | OWNER | C | ⤵ | deferred |

### 9.4 Adapter A — LAVA lab

| ID | Requirement | Source | Pri | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| LAVA-1 | Device-dictionary + device-type template generator (`paniolo lava device-dict`) | LAVA | M | ☐ | power_* → `paniolo power …`; connection → telnet |
| LAVA-2 | Generator supports list-valued power commands | LAVA | S | ☐ | |
| LAVA-3 | "First device" onboarding doc (Debian worker, ser2net/TCP wiring, tokens) | LAVA | S | ☐ | internet-reachable lab; tokens to KernelCI admins |
| LAVA-4 | Verified on a Debian LAVA worker against a real board | LAVA | S | ☐ | macOS unsupported (D-5) |

### 9.5 Adapter B — Fuchsia / botanist

| ID | Requirement | Source | Pri | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| FX-1 | botanist device-config emitter (`paniolo botanist device-config`) → PTY path | FX | M | ☐ | `{network,keys,serial}`; serial = PTY (SER-2) |
| FX-2 | Bot-host/recipe **power wrapper** calling `paniolo power {on\|reset\|off}` | FX | M | ☐ | power is NOT a device-config field |
| FX-3 | `bot_config.py` `get_dimensions()` snippet advertising `device_type:<board>` | FX | S | ☐ | + `bots.cfg`, `platforms.gni` (upstream coord) |
| FX-4 | Verify `DeviceConfig`/power plumbing against a real Fuchsia checkout | FX | M | ☐ | confirm `tools/botanist/target/device.go` |
| FX-5 | Document RFC-0130 Experimental tier (self-hosted CI) | FX | C | ☐ | community board is not "Supported" tier |

---

### 9.6 Adapter C — Redfish provider

> **Decision (D-9, 2026-05-29):** Redfish interop = **provider** direction (paniolo exposes a
> Redfish API in front of BMC-less boards), **not client**. Higher-leverage than per-ecosystem
> adapters because Redfish is the bare-metal lingua franca (Ironic/Metal3 primary control plane;
> LAVA can `curl` it). Sequenced **after** M1 — consumes the power verbs (PWR-1..6) and the raw
> serial socket (SER-1). Design sketch: [`ci-integration/redfish-provider.md`](ci-integration/redfish-provider.md).
> Verified against DMTF canonical CSDL (DSP0266 v1.22.0, DSP8010 2025.2), OpenBMC, Ironic/sushy.

| ID | Requirement | Source | Pri | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| RF-1 | Redfish provider service: `ServiceRoot` → `ComputerSystem` → `Manager` (→ `VirtualMedia`) resource tree | OWNER | S | ⤵ | deferred after M1; provider, not client |
| RF-2 | `#ComputerSystem.Reset` → power verbs (On→on, ForceOff→off, PowerCycle/ForceRestart→reset); `PowerState` → power-state | OWNER | S | ⤵ | depends on PWR-1..6 |
| RF-3 | `Boot.BootSourceOverrideTarget=Pxe` + `BootSourceOverrideEnabled=Once` → netboot | OWNER | S | ⤵ | maps to existing netboot |
| RF-4 | `VirtualMedia` `InsertMedia`/`EjectMedia` → image deploy | OWNER | C | ⤵ | open: needed vs. Pxe-once sufficient? |
| RF-5 | `SerialConsole` advertises out-of-band SSH/console endpoint pointing at paniolo raw-serial socket (metadata only) | OWNER | S | ⤵ | depends on SER-1; Redfish carries no serial bytes |
| RF-6 | Honest per-node `ResetType@Redfish.AllowableValues` / `ActionInfo` for the supported subset | OWNER | S | ⤵ | relay/DTR boards can't do every `ResetType` |
| RF-7 | Implement via a sushy-tools-style emulator + paniolo backend driver (not a hand-rolled OData service) | OWNER | S | ⤵ | open: dependency footprint (core = `typer` only) |
| RF-8 | Document/decide whether Redfish provider replaces or complements LAVA/botanist adapters | OWNER | S | ⤵ | botanist PTY serial seam still needs the direct path → not a full replacement |

## 10. Security

> **TODO — owner to populate.** This section needs dedicated attention and is intentionally
> unfinished. Paniolo grants an agent physical-equivalent control of a target (power, raw
> serial read/write, netboot/TFTP, HID injection) and, with the §9 work, opens **network-facing
> serial endpoints** and is **SSH-driven from a dev machine into the control host** — so the
> threat model and controls deserve first-class requirements, not afterthoughts.

| ID | Requirement | Pri | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| SEC-0 | Define paniolo's threat model and security requirements | M | ☐ | **Placeholder — to be written.** |

Prompts to resolve when populating (not yet requirements — discussion seeds):

- **Serial endpoint exposure (§9):** the raw TCP listener (SER-1) currently mirrors serialcap's
  loopback-only bind (`127.0.0.1`). For a LAVA worker / Swarming bot, who may connect? Auth,
  bind address, TLS, or rely on SSH-tunnel/localhost-only + network isolation?
- **Write arbitration as a safety control (SER-5/D-3):** is `--exclusive` purely cooperative, or
  also a guard against an unexpected writer driving the target?
- **Netboot/DHCP/TFTP:** read-only TFTP, single-client; any spoofing/rogue-DHCP concerns on a
  shared lab network vs. the assumed direct USB-Ethernet link?
- **Power/HID authority:** anyone who can reach the control host can power-cycle and inject HID —
  what bounds that (host access model, per-target ACLs)?
- **Secrets:** LAVA submission tokens, `$FUCHSIA_SSH_KEY`, CIPD/Swarming creds — storage and
  handling.
- **Supply chain:** `paniolo setup` builds/install Rust + Swift + Homebrew components.
