## 1. What paniolo is

Paniolo is an **agent-controlled target-machine wrangler** for low-level development
(bootloaders, firmware, OS bring-up). It gives an agent, human, or script the physical controls
of a target board: **netboot it, watch its output, send it input, power-cycle it**, with nobody
at the bench.

It is a **device-control layer**, not a test orchestrator. It owns power, serial, deploy
(netboot), video, HID (keyboard/mouse input), switchable USB media, and adb. It does *not* choose tests or produce
verdicts; in hardware CI those sit *above* it (see
[`ci-integration/`](../README.md#hardware-ci-integration-in-design)).

```

- The **control host** runs paniolo and is wired to one or more **targets** (DUTs, devices
  under test).
- The simplest driver is an **agent or script that SSHes into the control host** and runs
  `paniolo …` (see the root [`README.md`](https://github.com/curtisgalloway/paniolo/blob/main/README.md)).
- **Or use a [lab file](../distributed-control.md)** (`--lab` / `PANIOLO_LAB`): the dev machine
  drives a remote target transparently (commands re-exec over SSH, `console` tunnels the
  dashboard back). The dev machine is the data-plane hub; control hosts hold only runtime state
  (§5 "Distributed control").
- Runs on **macOS 10.14+** and **Linux** (x86-64/arm64); platform differences are in §8.

## 3. Process architecture

**One daemon per subsystem, no central server** (*Option A* in `AGENTS.md`). The `paniolo`
binary runs and exits. Per-subsystem **daemons** own a piece of hardware and persist between CLI
invocations. State lives in plain files.

| Component | Language | Role |
|---|---|---|
| `paniolo` CLI | Rust (clap) | The single entry point; spawns/queries daemons, edits the lab file, dispatches remote commands over SSH. |
| `serialcap` | Rust (tokio/axum) | Daemon that **exclusively owns** a target's serial ports; fans output out to a WebSocket + a timestamped capture log; accepts keystrokes back. |
| `hdmicap` | Rust (tokio/axum; ObjC AVFoundation layer on macOS, v4l on Linux) | "Warm-stream" daemon that keeps the USB HDMI capture device open and serves frames + the combined dashboard over HTTP. |
| `netbootd` | Rust (tokio) | Single-binary DHCP+TFTP+HTTP netboot engine. Privilege-separated `/dev/bpf` send path on macOS via a setuid `netbootd-bpf-helper`. |
| `cambrionix` | Rust | Standalone power helper: Cambrionix USB-hub port control, wired in via the generic power hooks. |
| `zigplug` | Python (uv tool, zigpy-znp) | Standalone power helper: Zigbee smart-plug control through a CC2652 coordinator; one-shots proxy through an auto-spawned daemon that owns the ZNP session. |
| `shellyplug` | Rust (ureq) | Standalone power helper: Shelly Gen2+ smart plugs/relays over the device's local HTTP RPC — one-shot, stateless. |
| `amt` | Rust (ureq) | Standalone power helper: Intel AMT/vPro power over WS-Management (port 16992, HTTP Digest), with true power-state readback from the ME. |
| `hidrig` | Rust | HID-injection helper: protocol client + `serve` daemon for the KB2040 injector, wired in via the generic `hid` channel. |
| `ch9329` | Rust | HID-injection helper with the same CLI + `serve` daemon, speaking the CH9329 (serial-to-USB-HID chip) frame protocol for Openterface Mini-KVM / KVM-Go and Sipeed NanoKVM-USB. |
| `visionocr` / `linuxocr` | Swift / shell+Tesseract | On-device OCR helpers invoked by `hdmicap` (`GET /ocr`, wrapped by `paniolo video read` and the dashboard OCR button). |
| HID rig firmware (separate repo) | CircuitPython | Two KB2040 (RP2040 microcontroller) boards: a "dumb pipe" relaying host-composed HID reports to the DUT as USB keyboard + mouse. Not in this repo: see [`paniolo-hardware`](https://github.com/curtisgalloway/paniolo-hardware)'s [`hidrig-kb2040/`](https://github.com/curtisgalloway/paniolo-hardware/tree/main/hidrig-kb2040), driven by the `hidrig` row above. |

Only `paniolo` lands on PATH (`~/.cargo/bin`). Helpers and daemons install into
`~/.local/libexec/paniolo/bin`: `paniolo helper <name>` runs one directly, and `paniolo daemons`
lists/stops/restarts running ones.

*Option B* (one long-running server with socket RPC) is noted in `AGENTS.md` but **not**
implemented. The only cross-subsystem coupling is the dashboard's hdmicap→serialcap link (§7).

## 4. Configuration and state model

**All configuration lives in one CLI-managed lab file**: `~/.config/paniolo/lab.toml`, or
`--lab` / `PANIOLO_LAB` (e.g. a git-tracked file). It names **hosts** and **targets**; each
target's hardware is a set of *channels* (`netboot`, `serial`, `power`, `video`, `hid`, `usb`, `adb`),
each bound to the host it is attached to. With exactly one target, the target argument may be
omitted. Schema (`cli/src/model.rs`):

```toml
[hosts.mac1]                     # optional — "local" is implicit; entries name remote hosts
ssh = "user@control-mac"         # how others reach it; identity / paniolo_cmd / control_path /
                                 #   description optional
# hostname = "mac1.local"        # this box's FQDN — set it so the host recognizes itself when one
#                                  shared lab file is run from any machine (matched vs `hostname -f`)

[targets.target-machine]
[targets.target-machine.netboot]
interface = "en3"                # USB-Ethernet interface for netboot
host_ip = "192.168.99.1"         # static IP on that interface; also the TFTP/HTTP server address
tftp_root = "/path/to/pxe"       # required to start netboot
# boot_file = "grubaa64.efi"     # UEFI NBP for PXE / HTTP Boot clients (http_port,
#                                #   content_type optional; see netboot.md)

[[targets.target-machine.serial]] # repeatable — a target may have several named consoles
name = "console"
device = "/dev/serial/by-id/…"   # stable symlink preferred (Linux): by-id names the
                                 #   adapter; by-path when it has no serial number
baud = 115200
power_sense_signal = "cts"       # optional; cts|dsr|dcd|ri — modem-control input wired to the rail
# power_button = true            # opt-in: DTR is wired to the board's power button
#                                #   (required by `serial dtr` / `serial reset`)

[targets.target-machine.power]   # generic hooks — device-specific logic lives in helpers
cycle_cmd = "zigplug … cycle …"  # `paniolo power-cycle`
on_cmd = "zigplug … on …"        # `paniolo power on`   (off_cmd / state_cmd likewise)
serial_interface = "console"     # default interface for DTR power commands

[targets.target-machine.video]
device = "USB Video"             # HDMI capture device for hdmicap

[targets.target-machine.hid]
cmd = "hidrig -d /dev/…"         # opaque helper prefix; `paniolo hid send` appends args

[targets.target-machine.usb]
cmd = "ch9329 -d /dev/…"         # helper prefix; paniolo appends only `usb host|target|state`

[targets.target-machine.adb]     # an Android DUT reached over adb
serial = "33271JEGR02033"        # `adb -s <serial>`; omit for the sole device
```

Every channel also takes an optional `host = "<name>"` binding it to a remote control host
(§5 "Distributed control"). Only the CLI edits the file (`paniolo target add`, `netboot set`,
`serial add`, `power set`, `video set`, `hid set`, …). The old per-target files
(`~/.config/paniolo/targets/<name>.toml`, `video.toml`) are not read.

**Runtime state, discovery, and capture** live outside the config tree:

- **Discovery and auth.** Each daemon writes an owner-only **discovery file** (pid + port + a
  per-start bearer **token**) and holds an **advisory lock**. Every request must carry the token
  (`Authorization: Bearer` from the CLI, `?token=` from the dashboard), and daemons accept only
  loopback `Host`/`Origin`. Binding 127.0.0.1 keeps other machines out; token and origin checks
  keep other *web pages* out (`cli/src/daemons.rs` `Endpoint`, each daemon's `auth.rs`).
- **Staleness.** The CLI records the daemon's binary identity at spawn (`binmeta.json`). A daemon
  running an older binary is flagged **stale** in `paniolo daemons`; `paniolo daemons restart`
  fixes it.
- **Instances.** Capture daemons (serialcap/hdmicap/hid) run one instance **per target**;
  zigplug/cambrionix/netbootd run one per host.
- **Helper env vars.** Every helper invocation gets two pre-created directories:
  `PANIOLO_STATE_DIR` (durable state, `~/.config/paniolo/helpers/<name>`) and
  `PANIOLO_RUNTIME_DIR` (`/tmp/paniolo-<uid>/<name>`; the capture daemons append a `/<target>`
  segment). The runtime base honors `$PANIOLO_RUNTIME_BASE` (default `/tmp`)
  (`cli/src/daemons.rs`; contract in [`adding-power-helpers.md`](adding-power-helpers.md)).
- **Private runtime directory.** Created 0700. An existing one must be a real directory owned
  by the current user: a too-open one we own is tightened; a symlink or another owner's is
  refused. Discovery-file readers check the same before trusting a `daemon.json`, and the SSH
  ControlMaster socket dir (`cli/src/ssh.rs`) is created through it. Daemon stderr logs and
  serialcap capture files are 0600.

The paths:

| Purpose | Path |
|---|---|
| Lab file (all config) | `~/.config/paniolo/lab.toml` (or `--lab` / `PANIOLO_LAB`) |
| Helper durable state (`PANIOLO_STATE_DIR`) | `~/.config/paniolo/helpers/<name>/` (e.g. zigplug's `zigbee.db`) |
| Netboot state (pids, uptime) | `~/.local/share/paniolo/<name>/netboot.json` |
| Netboot combined log | `~/.local/share/paniolo/<name>/netboot.log` |
| hdmicap discovery / lock (per target) | `/tmp/paniolo-<uid>/hdmicap/<target>/{daemon.json, daemon.lock}` |
| serialcap discovery / lock (per target) | `/tmp/paniolo-<uid>/serialcap/<target>/{daemon.json, daemon.lock}` |
| hid daemon discovery (channel name, any injector, per target) | `/tmp/paniolo-<uid>/hid/<target>/daemon.json` |
| zigplug daemon discovery (host singleton) | `/tmp/paniolo-<uid>/zigplug/daemon.json` |
| serialcap capture log (per interface) | `/tmp/paniolo-<uid>/serialcap/<target>/capture/<name>/serial.jsonl(.1..)` |
| serialcap pending (unterminated) line | `/tmp/paniolo-<uid>/serialcap/<target>/capture/<name>/pending.json` |

A `/tmp` age policy (Debian's `q /tmp 1777 root root 10d`) can delete these files under a
long-running daemon, which then holds its device while paniolo reports the channel stopped. The
`.deb` ships `/usr/lib/tmpfiles.d/paniolo.conf` (`x /tmp/paniolo-*`) to prevent it, and
`paniolo daemons` / `video show` / `video watch` reap any orphan (GitHub #187).

## 5. Subsystems

### Netboot / deploy ([`netboot.md`](../netboot.md))
`netbootd` runs **DHCP + TFTP + HTTP** as tokio tasks over a **direct USB-Ethernet link** (no
router, switch, or upstream DHCP, no `dnsmasq`).

- **Start.** `paniolo netboot start` assigns the static `host_ip`, then spawns `netbootd`, with
  `sudo` on Linux (ports 67/69 and 80 need root; macOS 10.14+ allows them rootless).
- **DHCP** hands the target a fixed lease and points it at the TFTP root via BOOTP `siaddr` +
  DHCP option 66. **TFTP** is read-only (RFC 1350 + blksize/tsize).
- **UEFI clients.** Dispatch is by DHCP vendor class: a `PXEClient` gets `boot_file` over TFTP;
  an `HTTPClient` gets an `http://…/<boot_file>` URL (HTTP Boot, see [`netboot.md`](../netboot.md)).

**Interface safety checks.** `paniolo netboot start` refuses:

- an interface carrying the system default route: it gets reconfigured to `host_ip`, so the
  netboot link must be a dedicated secondary (USB-Ethernet) interface.
- a second target on an interface another target's live netbootd already serves.

`netif::configure_interface` refuses a /24 that any *other* interface already holds (one subnet
per link, see docs/netboot.md). `LabFile::set_netboot` applies the same rule at edit time
(judging only the edited link, so a lab with two clashing pairs stays repairable), and `doctor`
reports it as `CONFLICT`. `netboot start` watches the daemon for ~2 s and, if it exits, fails
with the log tail instead of recording a dead daemon.

**Listening and privilege.** Every listener (DHCP, TFTP, HTTP) is pinned to the netboot
interface (`IP_BOUND_IF` / `SO_BINDTODEVICE`) before binding; a failed pin is fatal
(`--interface` is required). Startup: validate → bind and pin → drop root → serve. On Linux the
daemon drops to the invoking user (`SUDO_UID`/`SUDO_GID`) once bound, so no packet parsing runs
privileged; its later `sudo ip …` calls need passwordless sudo. The client lease is `host_ip`'s
/24 with last octet `100`. An HTTP bind failure disables only HTTP Boot.

**One client.** `netbootd` enforces one *client*, not just one lease:

- DHCP locks onto the MAC of the first DISCOVER/REQUEST for the life of the process and ignores
  other MACs, so a second device cannot take the lease, the ARP pin, or TFTP's raw-frame MAC.
- TFTP accepts RRQs only from the leased IP and caps concurrent transfers at `MAX_TRANSFERS`
  (a semaphore), so an RRQ flood cannot grow tasks/sockets/files without bound.

Neither gate resets in-process: a new client needs `paniolo netboot stop` then `start`.

**macOS BPF helper.** `netbootd`'s raw-frame send path (the Sequoia workaround) gets a
`/dev/bpf` descriptor from the setuid-root `netbootd-bpf-helper` over `SCM_RIGHTS`, installed by
`paniolo setup`; the daemon stays unprivileged. The descriptor is write-only with a reject-all
filter (inject, never capture), and the helper serves only its installing user and never the
default-route interface.

### Link mode: netboot · link · ffx · off ([`netif.md`](../netif.md))
The same USB-Ethernet link serves **mutually-exclusive** roles:

| Mode | Host side | Use |
|---|---|---|
| netboot | IPv4 + DHCP + TFTP + HTTP | the target TFTP-boots |
| `link` | host IP up, no daemon | link up/down testing |
| ffx | host IPv6 link-local `fe80::1`/64 | the target boots from SD and is reached over `ffx` (Fuchsia's host tool) at `fe80::…%<iface>` |
| `off` | host IP released | |

`paniolo netif mode <netboot|link|ffx|off>` (`cli/src/netif.rs`) switches atomically and
idempotently. `ffx` runs `netboot stop` first (so a power-cycle boots SD, not a stale TFTP
image) and adds the host `fe80::1` ffx needs.

The active mode is **probed** (daemons + interface addresses), not stored, so
`paniolo netif status` survives reboots. In ffx mode it reports the discovered link-local peer
(`ip -6 neigh`) as a paste-ready `ffx target add`.

`paniolo netif down-hard` goes beyond `mode off` when the target must *detect* link loss: it disables
Wake-on-LAN (which keeps the PHY energized) and admin-downs the interface so the peer sees
carrier drop, using netboot's `sudo` path.

### Serial console ([`serial.md`](../serial.md))
One `serialcap` daemon **per target exclusively owns all its serial interfaces**. Per interface,
a *supervisor* task owns the port (with a reconnect loop) and **fans every byte out three ways**:

1. broadcast to live WebSocket clients (`/stream`);
2. a 64 KB scrollback ring for instant replay;
3. a tee to a capture thread that writes **timestamped, sequence-numbered JSONL** lines to disk
   (rotating, survives restarts).

WebSocket clients send bytes the supervisor writes to the port. `paniolo serial log` reads the
JSONL **directly**, so it works with or without the daemon. `paniolo serial connect` execs `tio`
for a foreground terminal; it holds the port exclusively, so it conflicts with the daemon.

### Power control ([`power.md`](../power.md))
Two mechanisms:

- **DTR via FTDI.** The serial adapter's DTR line is wired to the board's J2 power-button header: `serial dtr`/`serial reset`, ≤500 ms soft / ≥3 s hard PMIC off.
- **Generic power hooks.** Arbitrary shell commands on the target's `power` channel
  (`cycle_cmd`/`on_cmd`/`off_cmd`/`state_cmd`, run by `paniolo power-cycle`, `power on/off`,
  `power-state`).

Device-specific logic lives in helpers behind those hooks, never in the core: `cambrionix`,
`zigplug`, `shellyplug`, and `amt` ship with paniolo, and `hidrig` can switch a DUT relay
(`hidrig power`). Without a `state_cmd`, `paniolo power-state` falls back to an optional
**power-sense** input on the target rail via serialcap's `/status`.

### Video + OCR ([`video.md`](../video.md))
`hdmicap` keeps a UVC HDMI capture device open (avoiding multi-second reopen latency) and serves
the current frame as PNG/MJPEG plus the dashboard over HTTP. `paniolo video read` (hdmicap's
`GET /ocr`) and the dashboard OCR button run **on-device OCR** on the warm frame: Apple Vision (`visionocr`) on macOS, Tesseract
(`linuxocr`) on Linux. Both are tuned for thin console fonts (2× upscale, black-pad,
`.fast`/lowered min text height).

### HID injection ([`hid.md`](../hid.md))
The dual-board rig appears to the DUT as a USB keyboard + mouse. `hidrig` composes HID reports
on the host and writes frames to the **control** board's USB-CDC port, which relays them over
I2C1 to the **target** board ([hid-dual-board-design.md](hid-dual-board-design.md)). The
[HID serial protocol](hid-serial-protocol.md) is only `hidrig`'s *external* command vocabulary.
paniolo drives the helper through the per-target `hid` channel, an opaque command prefix
(`paniolo hid send` appends arguments), like the power hooks.

### adb / Android targets ([`adb.md`](../adb.md))
The per-target `adb` channel binds an Android device (`adb -s <serial>`) to its control host,
giving the same verbs over one transport:

- console: `paniolo adb shell` (interactive), `adb run` (one-shot);
- screen: `adb screencap`, via `adb exec-out screencap -p` → PNG;
- input: `adb input` → `adb shell input`.

adb is a generic transport, so it lives in the core CLI (`cli/src/adb.rs`), shelling out to the
host's `adb` and routed like every other channel. For reboot/power, wire `adb reboot` through the
power hooks.

### Dashboard ([`dashboard.md`](../dashboard.md))
`paniolo console` opens hdmicap's `GET /`: live video on top, xterm.js terminal(s) below (§7).

### Distributed control ([`distributed-control.md`](../distributed-control.md))
Drives targets on **remote control hosts** over SSH only, with no coordinator daemon.

- The lab file names the hosts and binds each target's channels to one (`cli/src/model.rs`).
  `cli/src/ssh.rs` is the transport (per-host ControlMaster,
  `run`/`forward`/`run_interactive`).
- Commands that touch a remote channel **re-exec** on its host: `cli/src/dispatch.rs` ships the
  relevant lab slice as a temp file and re-invokes with `--lab`.
- `console` **tunnels** the daemon ports back and stitches them together with the dashboard's
  `?serialws=` override.
- `setup --host` provisions a host; `discover`/`configure` propose a lab block for review.
- A target's channels may span hosts; only `console` requires them co-located.

`console --detach` and locking remain design-only (see
[`distributed-control-plan.md`](https://github.com/curtisgalloway/paniolo/blob/main/notes/distributed-control-plan.md)).

## 6. Representative data flows

- **Boot-and-watch:** agent `scp`s an image into `tftp_root` → `netboot start` → target PXE-boots
  over the USB-Ethernet link → boot output streams through `serialcap` to the JSONL log → agent
  polls `serial log --since` (or watches the dashboard / OCRs the screen).
- **Serial round-trip:** UART bytes → supervisor → {WebSocket clients, scrollback, JSONL capture
  thread}; dashboard keystrokes → WebSocket → supervisor → UART.
- **Power-cycle from the dashboard:** browser → hdmicap `POST /power-cycle` → `paniolo
  power-cycle <target>` (target from `PANIOLO_TARGET`) → the target's `cycle_cmd` hook.

## 7. Cross-subsystem coupling (the dashboard)

hdmicap **serves the page** but references serialcap **only by URL**:

- `paniolo console` passes a complete loopback WebSocket URL, with serialcap's own token inside,
  as `?serialws=` (for a remote target, the tunnel's local port). hdmicap's token rides as
  `?token=`.
- The page refuses a non-loopback URL. Its built-in `ws://<host>:8724/stream` fallback applies
  only when the page is opened by hand.
- The page fetches serialcap's `/interfaces` and builds one xterm.js terminal per interface.

No daemon learns another's token. xterm.js is **vendored**, so the dashboard works on an
isolated network. Power controls appear only when hdmicap was started with a target; their
probe (`GET /power`) performs no power action.

## 8. Host-OS differences (macOS vs Linux)

Core power/serial/netboot works on both. Differences:

| Area | macOS | Linux |
|---|---|---|
| Netboot ports 67/69 | rootless (10.14+) | `sudo` (auto-prepended); netbootd drops root to `SUDO_UID` once bound |
| Listener pinning to the netboot interface | `IP_BOUND_IF` | `SO_BINDTODEVICE` (set while still root) |
| Interface config | `networksetup` / `ifconfig` | `ip addr`/`ip link` (iproute2) |
| ARP pinning | `arp -s` | `ip neigh replace … nud permanent` |
| TFTP egress workaround | BPF raw frames (`/dev/bpf*`) for Sequoia routing | normal `sendto()` |
| BPF descriptor access (rust engine) | setuid `netbootd-bpf-helper` passes the fd (daemon stays unprivileged) | n/a (kernel send path) |
| OCR backend | Apple Vision (`visionocr`, `swiftc`) | Tesseract (`linuxocr`, `tesseract-ocr` pkg) |
| Serial device discovery | `/dev/tty.usb*` | `/dev/serial/{by-id,by-path}/*` grouped per port, by-id preferred → `/dev/ttyUSB*`/`ACM*` |
| `paniolo setup` extras | compiles `visionocr` (`swiftc`) + installs setuid `netbootd-bpf-helper` (one sudo) | `linuxocr` (needs `tesseract-ocr` pkg) |

For headless CI (`ci-integration/`), the core path is clean on Linux.

## 9. Lifecycle & exclusivity notes

Serialcap, hdmicap, ch9329, hidrig, and zigplug's daemon accept an authenticated `POST /stop`.
Stop commands use it instead of signaling the discovery-file PID, which may have been reused;
it shares the signal handlers' cleanup and exit path.

- **Serial ports are exclusive.** Only one of `serialcap` / `tio` / `screen` can hold a port, so
  `serial watch` and `serial connect` conflict on the same device.
- **Daemons hard-exit on SIGTERM.** They serve infinite responses (`/preview` MJPEG, `/stream`
  WebSocket), so each removes its discovery file, waits ~300 ms, and calls `exit(0)`.
- **Daemon APIs are authenticated** (§4); no `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *`. A daemon from an
  older paniolo has no token; replace it with `paniolo daemons restart --stale`.
- **Interface configuration needs root.** Use NOPASSWD sudo for unattended agents.
- **Link modes (netboot / link / ffx / off) are mutually exclusive.** netboot and ffx need
  incompatible host addressing; `paniolo netif mode` tears down one when entering the other.

## 10. Where this is going

Paniolo is in daily use for hardware bring-up, with an agent deploying, booting, observing,
and power-cycling targets unattended.

Active work makes its primitives consumable by hardware-CI orchestrators (KernelCI/LAVA,
Fuchsia/botanist) via a stable device-control API plus thin adapters. Done: discrete power verbs
(`power on/off`) and `serial send`. Remaining: raw serial as a TCP socket + PTY, and a JTAG
extension point. Design and rationale are in [`ci-integration/design.md`](ci-integration/design.md) and
[`ci-integration/gap-analysis.md`](ci-integration/gap-analysis.md); progress is tracked in
[`requirements.md`](requirements.md).

## 11. Prior art & why paniolo

The closest tool is **labgrid** (Pengutronix, Python): also a device-control layer *under* a
test framework, with no verdicts of its own.

- **labgrid** is the mature **distributed** board-farm standard (coordinator/exporter/client over
  gRPC, a large driver catalog, multi-user locking), **Linux-only**. Use it for multi-board,
  multi-user farms.
- **Paniolo** serves the single-target bring-up loop: **single control host,
  zero-infrastructure, agent-in-the-loop**, with on-device **OCR**, a **USB-HID injection** rig,
  a combined video+serial dashboard, and first-class **macOS** support.

Where they overlap (raw-socket serial, discrete power verbs, a driver abstraction), labgrid
validates paniolo's CI-integration direction. Full comparison: [`ci-integration/related-work.md`](ci-integration/related-work.md).
