# Recipe: adding a power-control helper for new hardware

Use this to support a new power-switching device: a PDU (networked power
strip), relay board, smart-plug family, USB-PD hub, BMC, or anything else that
switches a target's power.

Device-specific logic never goes in the core crates ([power.md](../power.md)).
It lives in a standalone helper binary that paniolo drives through four shell
hooks on the target's power channel. `cli/` needs no changes beyond,
optionally, the install step.

Shipped examples:

| Helper | Language | Controls |
|---|---|---|
| [`cambrionix/`](https://github.com/curtisgalloway/paniolo/tree/main/cambrionix) | Rust | Cambrionix USB hubs, over the hub's control UART (serial port) |
| [`shellyplug/`](https://github.com/curtisgalloway/paniolo/tree/main/shellyplug) | Rust | Shelly Gen2+ plugs, over their local HTTP RPC |
| [`zigplug/`](https://github.com/curtisgalloway/paniolo/tree/main/zigplug) | Python | Zigbee smart plugs, via a CC2652 coordinator dongle |

## 1. The hook contract

Paniolo runs each hook with `sh -c <cmd>` (`cli/src/main.rs`,
`run_power_hook`):

| Hook | Run by | Contract |
|---|---|---|
| `on_cmd` | `paniolo power on` | exit 0 = success; a non-zero exit makes paniolo exit 101 (`helper_failed`, the hook's code in `child_exit`), or 3 (`not_configured`) for 126/127 — the hook is missing or not executable |
| `off_cmd` | `paniolo power off` | same |
| `cycle_cmd` | `paniolo power-cycle` | same; the hook owns the *full* sequence (off, delay, on, confirm) — paniolo adds no timing of its own |
| `state_cmd` | `paniolo power-state` | the **first whitespace-delimited token of stdout** must be `on` or `off` (case-insensitive); anything else, or a non-zero exit, is an error. Takes precedence over serial sense-line state when configured |

The environment the helper must tolerate:

- **`sh -c`, no shell profile.** PATH is paniolo's PATH with the helper dirs
  prepended: the private libexec dir (`~/.local/libexec/paniolo/bin`), then the
  system package dir (`/usr/libexec/paniolo/bin`). Helpers installed by
  `paniolo setup` or the .deb resolve by bare name; absolute paths also work.
  `paniolo doctor` checks absolute paths with `test -e` and bare names with
  `command -v` under the same resolution.
- **Runs on the channel's control host.** Power commands re-exec over SSH on
  the host that owns the channel (`paniolo power set --host <labhost>`).
  Install the helper on *that* host.
- **State and temp data go where paniolo says.** Every invocation gets two env
  vars naming existing directories:
    - `PANIOLO_STATE_DIR` (`~/.config/paniolo/helpers/<name>/`) for durable
      state (databases, pairing records).
    - `PANIOLO_RUNTIME_DIR` (`/tmp/paniolo-<uid>/<name>/`) for discovery files,
      locks, and logs. Wiped on reboot.

    `<name>` is the basename of the hook command's program (`zigplug …` →
    `zigplug`); channel daemons get the channel name instead (hidrig → `hid`).
    Prefer the env vars; fall back to the same literal paths when run
    standalone. **Never** write unnamespaced files into `~/.config/paniolo/`:
    the lab file lives there.
- **One-shot, stateless, exclusive.** Open the device, act, exit. Concurrent
  invocations collide on an exclusive-open serial port, so keep long-lived
  modes (pairing windows, monitors) off the hook paths.
- **stdout/stderr pass through**, except `state_cmd` stdout, which is parsed.
  On failure, print to stderr and exit non-zero.

## 2. Helper CLI conventions

Mirror the existing helpers:

```
<helper> -d <device> on <id>                  # switch on; confirm if the hw can report
<helper> -d <device> off <id>                 # switch off; confirm
<helper> -d <device> state <id>               # print exactly "on" or "off"
<helper> -d <device> cycle <id> [--delay-ms 3000]   # off → confirm → delay → on → confirm
<helper> -d <device> state                    # (optional) human-readable table of all ids
```

- `-d/--device` is the transport (serial port path, IP, hub address); `<id>`
  selects the outlet (hub port number, IEEE address, outlet index). Both live
  in the hook string, so the helper needs no configuration.
- **Confirm by read-back wherever the hardware reports state.** A silently
  failed power-cycle costs a debugging session.
    - `on`/`off` verify and exit non-zero on mismatch (`zigplug` reads the
      OnOff attribute back; `cambrionix` re-reads the port table after every
      `mode` command).
    - `cycle` confirms *both* phases, so a relay that ignored `off` is not
      reported as a successful cycle.
    - `state` maps only readings it understands; an unknown value is an error
      carrying the raw reading, never a guessed `off`.
- `cycle` defaults to a 3000 ms off-hold, enough for PSU capacitors to drain.
- Extra lifecycle commands are fine (`zigplug form` / `permit` / `list` /
  `remove`); keep them out of the hook strings.

## 3. Implementation skeleton

Use Rust for a simple serial/HTTP protocol, Python when the driver library is
Python (zigpy-znp). Any language works if it installs an executable into the
libexec dir (`~/.local/libexec/paniolo/bin`). Helpers stay off PATH; run one
by hand with `paniolo helper <name> …`.

Take state and temp paths from `PANIOLO_STATE_DIR`/`PANIOLO_RUNTIME_DIR` (§1);
zigplug's `default_db_path()` and `runtime_dir()` are the reference
implementations, including lazy migration from a pre-API path.

**Rust helper (the `cambrionix` pattern):**

1. `cargo new <helper> --bin` at the repo root; Apache 2.0 headers; `clap`
   (derive) + `anyhow` + whatever transport crate (`serialport`, `ureq`).
2. `main.rs` = CLI surface + command logic; `proto.rs` = transport/protocol.
3. Add the crate name to `CRATES` in [`Makefile`](https://github.com/curtisgalloway/paniolo/blob/main/Makefile) **and** to
   `HELPER_CRATES` in `cli/src/setup.rs` so `make install` / `paniolo setup`
   build and install it into the libexec dir (`cargo install --root`).
4. Give it a CI job (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) and a `crate_job` line in
   `scripts/ci-local.sh`; `scripts/ci-coverage-check.sh` enforces both.

**Python helper (the `zigplug` pattern):**

1. New top-level dir with its own `pyproject.toml` (a uv project, **not** part
   of the root legacy package): `[tool.uv] package = true`,
   `[project.scripts] <helper> = "<pkg>._cli:app"`, src layout, typer CLI.
2. Wrap async device libraries with one `asyncio.run()` per subcommand. Map
   library exceptions to one-line errors; a traceback in hook output looks
   like paniolo breakage.
3. Add an install block to `cli/src/setup.rs` following zigplug's: probe for
   `uv`, run `uv tool install --force <repo>/<helper>` with
   `UV_TOOL_BIN_DIR` set to the libexec dir, and skip with a note when uv is
   missing.
   Mention it in the Makefile header comment.

Either way, **install the helper before testing hooks** (`paniolo setup`, or
`cargo install --path <helper> --root ~/.local/libexec/paniolo` for a
one-off); paniolo runs installed binaries, not checkouts.

## 4. Hardware verification ladder

Climb in order; each rung isolates one layer and the destructive test is last.

1. **Identify the device node first.** `ioreg -p IOUSB -w0` (macOS) /
   `lsusb` + `/dev/serial/by-id/` (Linux). Don't guess from `/dev`: chips
   without a serial number (e.g. CP2102N) are named by USB topology on macOS
   (`/dev/cu.usbserial-8310` ↔ location `08310000`) and rename when moved.
2. **Run the helper directly** (`paniolo helper <name> …`): any lifecycle
   setup (e.g. `paniolo helper zigplug form` + `permit`), then `state <id>`,
   `on`, `off`, `cycle`. Confirm each physically (relay click, LED,
   multimeter).
3. **`paniolo power-state <target>`**: read-only. Proves the hook string, the
   `sh -c` environment, and the `on`/`off` token contract.
4. **`paniolo power on/off <target>`**: switching through the full stack.
5. **`paniolo power-cycle <target>`**: last, because it reboots the target.
6. `paniolo doctor`: confirms which hooks are configured and that each hook's
   program exists.

## 5. Wiring into a target

```bash
paniolo power set -t <target> \
    --cycle-cmd "<helper> -d <device> cycle <id>" \
    --on-cmd    "<helper> -d <device> on <id>" \
    --off-cmd   "<helper> -d <device> off <id>" \
    --state-cmd "<helper> -d <device> state <id>" \
    [--host <labhost>]        # the control host that owns the hardware
```

All four hooks are optional; wire what the hardware supports. Take secrets
(API tokens) from the environment, never the hook string (see the Home
Assistant example in [power.md](../power.md)).

## 6. Docs + PR checklist

- [ ] `docs/power.md` — usage section: install, setup, commands, hook
      wiring, hardware gotchas
- [ ] `AGENTS.md` — directory-layout entry + the power bullet in
      "Current capabilities"
- [ ] `README.md` — both helper lists (the power row in the subsystem table
      and the `make install` paragraph) + the manual install command block
- [ ] `Makefile` — `CRATES` (Rust) or the header comment (other)
- [ ] `cli/src/setup.rs` — `HELPER_CRATES`, so `paniolo setup` installs the
      helper from a source clone
- [ ] `.github/workflows/release.yml` — the `HELPERS` env list **and** the
      rust-cache `workspaces` block, or the `.deb`/tarball silently omits the
      binary (v0.1.13 shipped without `amt` this way).
- [ ] `packaging/nfpm.yaml` — the helper list in the package description
- [ ] `.github/workflows/ci.yml` — a job for the new crate
      (`working-directory: <crate>`; copy an existing crate job) **and** a
      matching `crate_job` line in `scripts/ci-local.sh`. The `coverage` job
      (`scripts/ci-coverage-check.sh`) fails until both exist, or if the
      `Makefile`, release `HELPERS`, or `HELPER_CRATES` lists omit the crate.
- [ ] `docs/README.md` — the Power row in the subsystem guide table
- [ ] Apache 2.0 headers on all new source files

## 7. Field notes (earned the hard way)

- **2.4 GHz radios hate USB 3.** zigplug network formation failed with
  zigpy-znp's "too much RF interference" error while the dongle sat next to a
  USB video-capture device; a USB 2.0 extension cable fixed it. Move a radio
  dongle before debugging software.
- **Verify the library API against the installed version.** Device libraries
  (zigpy et al.) break APIs across major versions.
- **One-shot for stateless transports; a daemon for stateful ones.**
    - A self-contained request/response transport (the `cambrionix` UART) is
      fine one-shot; it avoids a service to install and supervise.
    - A transport with *session state* needs a persistent owner. zigplug's
      one-shot version reset the CC2652 on every serial open (sometimes into
      the bootloader, hanging the client), and two concurrent hooks on one ZNP
      session wedged the coordinator for hours and lost its NVRAM.
    - The zigplug fix: an auto-spawned daemon owns the port and serializes
      operations with hard timeouts; the CLI proxies to it. Hook strings stay
      one-shot-shaped (`hidrig serve` does the same on the KVM path).
- **Make `state` cheap and accurate.** Agents poll it. Never cache on the
  helper side; fail loudly rather than guess.
