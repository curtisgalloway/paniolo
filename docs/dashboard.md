# Combined dashboard

One web page to watch and drive a target: live video on top, a serial
terminal below. hdmicap (video daemon) serves the page; the terminal connects
to serialcap (serial daemon) over WebSocket.

---

## Starting the dashboard

```bash
paniolo console                  # open in the default browser
```

`paniolo console` starts any daemon not already running (hdmicap, serialcap,
and the hid daemon if the target has a `hid` channel), then opens the page.
`paniolo video watch` / `paniolo serial watch` start them individually.

**Use the URL the browser was handed**, not a bare `http://127.0.0.1:<port>/`:
it carries each daemon's token (hdmicap's as `?token=`, the others inside
`?serialws=`/`?hidws=`). `console` prints only the bare address, to keep tokens
out of pasted output. If no browser launches, it writes the full URL to a
`0600` `dashboard-url.txt` in the target's runtime dir and prints that path.

The page shows one terminal pane per serialcap interface. To pin one
interface (single-pane mode):

```bash
paniolo console -i bmc
```

## Features

**Live video (noVNC):** the video pane is a vendored
[noVNC](https://github.com/novnc/noVNC) viewer on hdmicap's `GET /rfb`, so it
works for every video source, a USB capture device or a network one. Only the
screen tiles that changed are sent (lossless ZRLE; a mostly-text 1080p frame
measured 81,417 bytes against 8,294,400 raw), and the view scales to the pane.
A **video: VNC | MJPEG** toggle switches to the older MJPEG stream (the choice
is remembered in `localStorage` under `paniolo-video-mode`). If `/rfb` cannot
connect, for instance to a daemon from an older paniolo, the page falls back to
MJPEG on its own.

**Typing and pointing in the VNC view:** click into the video and type. When
the target has a `hid` channel on the control host, key and pointer events go to
the target's hid daemon, intermixed with CLI `paniolo hid send` input. Details:

- Keys: printable ASCII, editing and navigation keys, F1 to F12, modifiers
  (Meta maps to Alt, AltGr to Right Alt), and the keypad (mapped to the
  main-block keys). F13 to F24 and keysyms outside that set are dropped, since
  the hid vocabulary has no F13 and up.
- The pointer is absolute (scaled to 0..32767); the wheel scrolls. Held keys
  and buttons are released when the page disconnects.
- With no `hid` channel the view is watch-only.
- `video watch`, `console` and `daemons restart` start the target's local hid
  daemon for every video device, not just `rfb+hid:`. On a USB-capture target
  with a `hid` channel, starting video therefore also starts the hid daemon,
  which then owns the injector. If the hid daemon fails to start, the view
  stays watch-only and the command prints a note; only `rfb+hid:` treats that
  as an error.
- `GET /status` reports `rfb_clients` and `rfb_input` (up to 8 viewers at once).

**`/rfb` is not a general VNC server.** It is a WebSocket endpoint (RFB 3.8,
3.7 and 3.3, security None, subprotocol `binary`) that needs hdmicap's token, as
`Authorization: Bearer` or `?token=`. There is no plain TCP RFB listener, so a
desktop VNC client cannot connect; use noVNC-style clients.

**Serial terminal:** xterm.js, vendored, so it works on an isolated lab
network. The `?interface=<name>` URL parameter (or `console -i <name>`) pins
one interface.

**Layout toggle:** switches the terminal between bottom (default, 40 vh) and
right-panel (380 px) layouts; saved in `localStorage`.

**OCR button:** calls `GET /ocr` on hdmicap, which OCRs the current frame
(`visionocr` on macOS, `linuxocr` on Linux). Needs the OCR helper
(`paniolo setup`).

**Capture input (KVM, MJPEG mode only):** in the MJPEG view, with a `hid`
channel, **⌨ Capture input** sends your
keyboard and absolute mouse to the target; it reads **⌨ Capturing** while
active. Click again or leave the window to release. Your cursor stays visible
(no pointer lock), and CLI `paniolo hid send` input intermixes. See
[HID injection › KVM mode](hid.md#kvm-mode-type-and-click-from-the-web-console).

**Power:** with a `power` channel, a live **toggle switch**
(`Power [switch] ON/OFF`) and a **⟳ Cycle** button, each confirming before it
acts. Loading the page never powers the target (`GET /power` only reads).

## URL parameters

| Parameter | Effect |
|---|---|
| `?token=<token>` | hdmicap's own token; the page puts it on every request it makes back to hdmicap |
| `?serialws=<url>` | Connect the terminal to this serialcap WebSocket URL, serialcap's `?token=` inside (percent-encoded; what `paniolo console` passes) |
| `?serial=<port>` | Connect to serialcap on this local port; no token, so only a daemon started without one accepts it |
| `?serial=none` | No terminal pane (a target with no serial channel) |
| `?interface=<name>` | Preselect a named serial interface |
| `?hidws=<url>` | Enable KVM input via this hid WebSocket URL, hid's `?token=` inside (what `paniolo console` passes) |
| `?hid=<port>` | Enable KVM input via the hid daemon on this local port (no token, as for `?serial=`) |

`serialws`/`hidws` (and URLs built from `serial`/`hid`) must be loopback
(`127.0.0.1`, `localhost` or `[::1]`); the page refuses anything else. It also
refuses to render in a frame (`Content-Security-Policy:
frame-ancestors 'none'`).

---

## Third-party code

The page vendors xterm.js and noVNC v1.7.0 so it works on an isolated network.
noVNC is one esbuild bundle (`hdmicap/assets/novnc.js`) under MPL-2.0, with its
pako dependency under MIT; both notices are in
`hdmicap/assets/novnc-LICENSE.txt`. `scripts/vendor-novnc.sh` rebuilds it
reproducibly from a pinned, checksummed release.

---

## Connecting the daemons

`paniolo console` reads each daemon's discovery file (port and token) and
passes `?serialws=ws://127.0.0.1:<port>/stream?token=…` and
`?hidws=…/hid?token=…`; over a remote tunnel, `<port>` is the tunnel's local
end.

The `?serial=` / `?hid=` port forms carry no token, so they work only against a
daemon started by an older paniolo. With no parameters, the page falls back to
`ws://<host>:8724/stream` (the standalone `serialcap --port` default).
