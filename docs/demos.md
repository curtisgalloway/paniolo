# Demos

Recordings from the CI rack, made from a laptop with the boards in another
room. Every command is a real `paniolo` invocation, dispatched over SSH to the
Raspberry Pi control host that owns the cables. Where a demo drives a screen,
the capture is followed by the transcript of what the agent typed — static
text, so you can read it at your own pace while the capture loops.

The transcripts are the terminal output of the asciinema casts in
[`docs/demo/`](https://github.com/curtisgalloway/paniolo/tree/main/docs/demo)
(`asciinema play docs/demo/<name>.cast`), ANSI stripped, otherwise untouched.

## Puppeting the NUC BIOS

`lab-nuc-1` — Intel NUC11, AMI visual BIOS, Sipeed NanoKVM-USB · channels:
video + OCR, hid, serial.

The one that is genuinely hard to automate. The NUC is parked in firmware
setup; the agent OCRs the page, discards and exits, then hammers `F2` through
the KVM's emulated keyboard during POST and waits for the firmware to come
back — verified by reading the screen, not by sleeping. Then absolute-mouse to
the Boot tab, into Boot Priority, OCR the boot order, and back out without
saving. In the capture you can watch the reboot: setup → black → Intel splash →
setup again, then the mouse clicks landing. The OCR lines are verbatim
Tesseract output from the control host, stray glyphs included.

![paniolo console: the NUC exits BIOS setup, POSTs, re-enters on F2, and is navigated to Boot Priority by mouse](demo/nuc-bios-puppet-screen.gif)

```console
# lab-nuc-1 is an Intel NUC11 on the CI rack, parked in BIOS setup from an earlier take.

## Puppeting a live desktop

`lab-pi-1` — Raspberry Pi 5, Pi OS desktop, Sipeed KVM-USB · channels: video,
hid.

A KVM you can script. The pointer is absolute, so the agent parks it
mid-screen, clicks the terminal in the taskbar, and types into it keystroke by
keystroke over the wire — `echo`, then `uname -a` (note the `--`: everything
after it is text for the helper's `type`, not options) — then leaves the
desktop as it found it.

![paniolo console: a terminal opens on the Pi desktop and text is typed into it by emulated HID](demo/pi-desktop-puppet-screen.gif)

```console
# A live desktop, seen through a capture dongle, driven by emulated HID.
# The pointer is absolute — put it in the middle of the screen:
$ paniolo hid send -t lab-pi-1 moveabs 16000 16000
OK

# Open a terminal from the taskbar:
$ paniolo hid send -t lab-pi-1 moveabs 2560 546
OK
$ paniolo hid send -t lab-pi-1 click left
OK

# Type into it — keystroke by keystroke, over the wire:
$ paniolo hid send -t lab-pi-1 type echo driven by a keyboard that does not exist
OK
$ paniolo hid send -t lab-pi-1 key ENTER
OK
$ paniolo hid send -t lab-pi-1 type -- uname -a
OK
$ paniolo hid send -t lab-pi-1 key ENTER

# Leave it as we found it:
$ paniolo hid send -t lab-pi-1 type exit

## Out-of-band power over Intel AMT

`optiplex` — Dell OptiPlex 7060, Intel AMT/vPro, no plug and no relay ·
channel: power ([`amt` helper](power.md#intel-amt-power-control-amt)).

This box has no smart plug and no relay. Its power facility is the
Management Engine inside the chipset, reached over one ethernet cable, awake on
the standby rail even when the machine is off. `power off` kills it without
consulting the OS; `power-state` then reports **OFF** from the ME itself — real
readback, not a guess — and `power on` brings it back.

```console
# This target has no smart plug and no relay. Its power facility is
# Intel AMT: the Management Engine inside the chipset, reached over
# one ethernet cable — even when the machine is off.
$ paniolo power-state optiplex
Power ON  (optiplex)

# Kill it. The OS is not consulted.
$ paniolo power off optiplex
Powering off 'optiplex' via paniolo helper amt off -d 192.168.99.50 -u admin
power: off
Power off complete.
$ paniolo power-state optiplex
Power OFF  (optiplex)

# The host is dead — that answer came from the ME on the standby rail.
$ paniolo power on optiplex
Powering on 'optiplex' via paniolo helper amt on -d 192.168.99.50 -u admin
power: on
Power on complete.
$ paniolo power-state optiplex
Power ON  (optiplex)

# True out-of-band power with real state readback: paniolo's amt helper.
```

## Cold-booting a Pi and catching it die

`lab-pi-1` — Raspberry Pi 5, USB-C power through a relay board on the control
host, FTDI console · channels: power, serial.

`power-cycle` cuts VBUS, holds five seconds, restores it — and the serial
capture daemon records every byte of the cold boot. The transcript then greps
the log for the bootloader's `power-on-reset 1`, the proof it was a genuine
cold start, back to a login prompt in about 35 seconds.

```console
# lab-pi-1: a Raspberry Pi 5 on the CI rack, driven from another room.
# Its USB-C power feeds through a relay board on the control host.
$ paniolo power-state lab-pi-1
Power ON  (lab-pi-1)

# Cycle it, and catch the machine dying:
$ paniolo power-cycle lab-pi-1
Power cycling 'lab-pi-1' via python3 /home/curtisg/src/usb-relay/host/usbrelay.py --port /dev/serial/by-id/usb-Raspberry_Pi_Pico_503558607AC7371F-if02 cycle 1
OK cycle 1 5.0
Power cycle complete.
$ paniolo power-state lab-pi-1
Power OFF  (lab-pi-1)

# VBUS is cut. Five seconds later power returns, and the serial capture
# daemon records every byte of the cold boot. Waiting for the login prompt...

## Stills

Single frames from the same captures (1280×720) — lighter than any GIF, and
honest about what the capture path actually sees.
