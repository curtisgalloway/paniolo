# Advisory only — never reaps daemons. paniolo's daemons (serialcap, hdmicap,
# netbootd) are per-user processes, not packaged system services, so a root
# maintainer script can't reliably stop another user's running daemons (their
# state lives under per-user runtime dirs, and killing an in-flight netboot on
# a routine upgrade would be surprising). After an upgrade, any daemon still
# running keeps executing the OLD binary until restarted. The CLI detects this
# (`paniolo daemons` flags such daemons "stale") and heals it on demand.
#
# dpkg runs this as `postinst configure <previously-configured-version>`, and
# that second argument is empty on a fresh install (Debian Policy 6.5). It is
# the one thing that tells a first-time installer from an upgrader, and the
# two need different advice: the upgrader has daemons to restart, the
# first-timer has nothing running yet and wants to know where to start (#228).
# nfpm ships this script only in the .deb, so the rpm-style numeric argument
# convention does not apply.
