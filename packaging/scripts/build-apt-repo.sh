# Assemble the signed apt repository that docs.yml publishes to GitHub Pages
# under /apt/. Stateless by design: point it at a directory of .debs (the
# workflow downloads them from recent GitHub Releases) and it emits a complete
# pooled repo — pool/, per-arch Packages indexes, a GPG-signed
# Release/InRelease, and the public key as paniolo.asc — into the output dir.
# Nothing is kept between runs, so the live repo always mirrors the releases.
#
# The signing key must already be imported into the calling GNUPGHOME and must
# have no passphrase (CI runs non-interactively).
#
# Usage: build-apt-repo.sh <debs-dir> <out-dir> <signing-key-fingerprint>
