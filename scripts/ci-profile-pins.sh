# Enforce the release-train profile's freshness rule: every path pinned in
# RELEASE-TRAIN.md's `## Sources` table still hashes to the blob id recorded
# beside it.
#
# The table exists because the profile states facts *derived* from those files
# -- which workflow job builds an arm, what the smoke contract can assume, how
# a version is bumped. When a source changes, the prose it feeds may have
# become wrong, and only a human re-reading it can say. The pin is how the next
# release knows to look.
#
# Nothing enforced this until now, and it drifted twice through green CI
# (GitHub #219): AGENTS.md in #209 and cli/src/daemons.rs in #213. The first
# thing to notice would otherwise be the release train itself, mid-release.
#
# Deliberately NOT the release-train skill's `profile_check.py`. That script
# lives in another repository and answers a broader question -- whether the
# profile is well-formed enough for the train to execute (paths, headings,
# channels, smoke subcommands). That belongs at release time, where the skill
# is being invoked anyway. CI needs one question answered on every commit, and
# making this repo's CI clone a personal skills repo would break forks and add
# a cross-repo dependency to every run. The two are kept in agreement by using
# git's own blob id, which is a frozen format rather than a shared API.
#
# When this fails, re-read the sections the changed row feeds, then re-pin.
# The skill's `profile_check.py --update` rewrites the ids; so does:
#     git hash-object --no-filters <path> | cut -c1-12
#
# Run it anywhere: it needs a shell, sed, awk and git.
