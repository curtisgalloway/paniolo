# Sync crate sources to the Windows bench host for a build there.
#
# Usage: BRIK_HOST=<ssh host> BRIK_DEST=<path on host> \
#          scripts/sync-brik.sh <crate> [crate...]
#
# BRIK_HOST is the ssh destination (a hostname or an ~/.ssh/config alias) and
# BRIK_DEST the checkout on it, in the forward-slash form the host's tar takes
# (e.g. C:/src/paniolo). Both come from the environment and have no default:
# the real values name private infrastructure, which does not belong in the
# repo (AGENTS.md, "Never commit private infrastructure").
#
# Excludes target/ deliberately: the build dirs are gigabytes and the transfer
# stalls the SSH session long before it finishes. Only sources, manifests and
# lockfiles cross the wire; the host keeps its own target/.
#
# BRIK_SSH_AGENT points ssh at a session-scoped agent (see the homelab-ssh
# skill) so a locked 1Password desktop app cannot interrupt a long build.
