# Reproduce the Linux GitHub CI jobs (.github/workflows/ci.yml) locally, so you
# can catch failures before pushing. Run it inside a Linux environment:
#
#   # On a Mac, via a Lima VM (Linux on macOS):
#   limactl shell <instance> -- bash -l <repo>/scripts/ci-local.sh
#
#   # Or directly on a Linux box / dev container:
#   bash scripts/ci-local.sh
#
# It mirrors every Linux crate job in ci.yml; scripts/ci-coverage-check.sh
# enforces that the two stay in sync.
#
# It installs the toolchain if missing (rustup + uv + apt build deps) and copies
# the working tree to a VM-local dir before building, so nothing is written to a
# shared host mount (a virtiofs/9p mount rejects setuptools' editable egg-info
# and would clobber a host cargo target/). The macOS-only CI job (hdmicap
# AVFoundation + visionocr) is not covered here — run it on the host.
