# Enforce the supply-chain rule: every third-party GitHub Action is pinned to
# a full 40-hex commit SHA (Review M7).
#
# `uses: owner/repo@v3` resolves a movable tag at run time; whoever can move
# that tag (a compromised maintainer account, a hijacked repository) runs
# their code in this project's CI with its token. A commit SHA is immutable.
# The `actions-pinned` CI job runs this script; .github/dependabot.yml keeps
# the pins current by bumping the SHA and its `# vX.Y.Z` comment together.
#
# Accepted forms of a `uses:` line:
#   owner/repo[/path]@<40 hex>  # vX.Y.Z   the comment is required: it is how a
#                                          reader knows what the SHA is, and
#                                          how Dependabot knows what to bump
#   ./path/to/action                       an action in this repo (no ref)
#   docker://image@sha256:<64 hex>         a digest-pinned container image
#
# Run it anywhere: it needs nothing but a shell, find and grep.
