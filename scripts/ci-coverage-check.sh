# Enforce the project rule: every Rust crate in the repo has a CI job.
#
# A crate is "covered" when its directory appears as a `working-directory:`
# value in .github/workflows/ci.yml -- so a new crate that nobody wired into
# CI fails the build instead of silently going untested for months. It also
# checks scripts/ci-local.sh, which must mirror the Linux jobs so maintainers
# can reproduce them before pushing.
#
# It also enforces that every helper crate (every crate except cli) ships:
# it must appear in the HELPERS list of .github/workflows/release.yml (the
# .deb/tarball contents) and in HELPER_CRATES of cli/src/setup.rs (source
# installs). A helper missing from either builds green in CI and then silently
# never reaches users -- v0.1.13 shipped without the amt helper this way.
# A library crate (no src/main.rs and no [[bin]], e.g. secret) is not a helper:
# it ships inside the helpers that depend on it, so only the CI, ci-local and
# Makefile checks apply to it.
#
# Go modules (a directory with a go.mod) are not Cargo crates, so they get their
# own, equally strict, checks: a `working-directory:` job in ci.yml, a
# `go_job` line in ci-local.sh, and a mention in GO_HELPERS of cli/src/setup.rs
# (source installs). Release packaging is the one thing a Go module may defer,
# and only through GO_RELEASE_EXEMPT below, with the reason written down.
#
# Run it anywhere: bash scripts/ci-local.sh needs a Linux box, this needs
# nothing but a shell.
