"""Tests for issue #219: scripts/ci-profile-pins.sh fails the build when a
path pinned in RELEASE-TRAIN.md's `## Sources` table no longer hashes to the
blob id recorded beside it.

The script is what stops the profile stating facts derived from a file that has
since moved on -- it had already drifted twice through a full green CI matrix
before it existed. Nothing exercised the script itself, so a revert of any of
its three verdicts (current, stale, unusable table) left the suite green.

Every case runs the real script as a subprocess against a synthetic profile,
because the exit status is the whole contract: CI reads nothing else. Exit 0 is
"every pin current", 1 is "a pin is stale or its file is gone", and 2 is "the
table could not be read", which must never be reported as a pass -- a checker
that silently passes is worse than none.

The script always hashes relative to the repository root, whatever profile it
is handed, so these profiles pin real tracked files (`README.md`, `LICENSE`)
and vary only the blob ids.
