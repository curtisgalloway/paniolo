"""Tests for issue #228: packaging/scripts/postinstall.sh told a fresh
install it was an upgrade.

dpkg runs this script as `postinst configure <previously-configured-version>`,
and that second argument is empty only on a first-time install (Debian Policy
6.5). Before the fix the script printed the "upgrade complete" wording
unconditionally, so a brand-new user was told to restart daemons that never
existed and was never told to run `paniolo setup`.

Each case runs the real script as a subprocess with the arguments dpkg would
pass, because the printed wording is the whole user-visible contract.
