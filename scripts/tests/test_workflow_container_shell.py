"""A container job's steps must not use bash-only shell syntax.

A job with `container:` gets `sh -e {0}` as its default shell, and in the
Debian images this repo builds in, /bin/sh is dash. dash has no `pipefail`
and exits 2 on `set -o pipefail` with "Illegal option -o pipefail".

This is a release-blocking class of bug rather than an ordinary one, because
`release.yml` runs only on a tag push: pull-request CI never executes it, and
the release train builds the .deb by replaying the profile's recipe by hand
rather than by running the workflow. So nothing exercises these steps until
a tag is pushed, and by then the tag exists. That is exactly what happened on
2026-09-19 -- the v0.4.0 tag build failed on both Linux arches, no GitHub
Release was produced, and the tag had to be moved.

A step that genuinely needs bash may have it, by declaring `shell: bash`
(the Debian images do ship bash); this test only rejects bash syntax in a
step that has not asked for bash.
