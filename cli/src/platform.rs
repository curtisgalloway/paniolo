//! The POSIX facilities paniolo depends on, behind a portable surface.
//!
//! Paniolo grew up on macOS and Linux, so process and filesystem primitives
//! were reached for directly (`libc::getuid`, `libc::kill`, `CommandExt::exec`,
//! `DirBuilderExt::mode`). Windows has none of those. Rather than sprinkle
//! `#[cfg]` through the call sites, every such primitive lives here with one
//! implementation per platform and a single documented contract.
//!
//! The same module is duplicated (deliberately, matching how `daemon.rs` is
//! duplicated) in the helper crates that run daemons — hdmicap, serialcap,
//! ch9329, hidrig. Keep the four in sync.
