//! Owns the serial port. A supervisor task opens the port, reconnects on
//! loss/hot-unplug, fans received bytes out to all WebSocket clients via a
//! `broadcast` channel, and drains a single `mpsc` of client input back to the
//! port. A small ring buffer keeps recent output so a client that connects
//! mid-stream sees scrollback (e.g. boot log already in progress).
//!
//! Every received chunk is also tee'd to a dedicated OS thread that owns the
//! [`capture::LineLog`], which assembles timestamped lines and persists them to
//! disk. Keeping that work (and its file I/O) off the supervisor's select loop
//! means a slow disk can never stall the live WebSocket fan-out.
