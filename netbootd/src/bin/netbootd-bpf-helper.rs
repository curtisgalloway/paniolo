//! `netbootd-bpf-helper` — the *only* privileged component of netboot.
//!
//! Installed setuid-root by `paniolo setup` (the one-time `sudo`). Its entire
//! job: open `/dev/bpf` **write-only**, bind it to the requested interface, set
//! `BIOCSHDRCMPLT`, install a reject-all filter, and hand the descriptor back
//! to its (unprivileged) caller over the inherited socketpair fd via
//! `SCM_RIGHTS`, then exit. It never reads from the network, never writes
//! frames, and holds root for only microseconds.
//!
//! Because it is setuid-root and world-executable, every input is treated as
//! hostile and two gates run before `/dev/bpf` is touched:
//!
//! 1. **Who is asking.** The caller's *real* uid must be root or the owner of
//!    the directory this executable lives in — the user who installed it
//!    ([`netbootd::handoff::caller_allowed`]). Anyone else gets
//!    `refused: caller uid N is not the installing user (uid M)`.
//! 2. **Which interface.** The interface carrying the host's default route is
//!    refused ([`netbootd::handoff::interface_refused`]) so the helper can
//!    never hand out a send handle on the primary NIC; the lookup runs
//!    `/sbin/route` by absolute path with an empty environment
//!    ([`netbootd::route`]). Refusal reads `refused: <iface> carries the
//!    default route`.
//!
//! The interface name itself is validated in [`netbootd::handoff::open_bpf`],
//! and the handoff fd is the only descriptor the helper writes to.
//!
//! Usage: `netbootd-bpf-helper --interface <name> --handoff-fd <n>`
