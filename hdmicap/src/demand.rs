//! What the daemon's clients currently want from the capture loop (#221).
//!
//! The capture loop used to run at `TARGET_FRAME_INTERVAL` whenever anything
//! held a receiver, so a daemon nobody was looking at cost as much CPU as one
//! streaming to a browser. The server now records demand here and the Linux
//! capture loop picks its interval from it:
//!
//! - a **stream** — an open `/preview`, or a `/snapshot` waiting on
//!   `changed_since`/`wait=stable` — wants every frame for as long as it lasts;
//! - a **pull** — `/snapshot`, `/ocr` — wants one fresh frame now, and may
//!   come back for more in a moment.
//!
//! A pull that finds the warm frame older than [`FRESH_ENOUGH`] wakes the
//! capture thread and waits briefly for the next frame, so dropping the idle
//! rate never hands an agent a picture of the screen from before its last
//! action.
//!
//! Only the Linux loop sleeps between frames; on macOS and Windows the backend
//! blocks on the device's own cadence, and this record goes unread.

///   is served stale frames;
/// - right after a pull (`since_pull` near zero) the answer is
