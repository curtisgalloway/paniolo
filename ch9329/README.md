# ch9329 — CH9329 USB-HID injector for paniolo

`ch9329` is a paniolo `hid` helper (the target's keyboard and mouse) for the
**WCH CH9329**, a chip that turns UART commands into USB keyboard and mouse
input on the target. It has the **same CLI surface** as
[`hidrig`](../hidrig/README.md), so `paniolo hid send` drives it the same way.

| Device | How it connects | Status |
|---|---|---|
| **[Openterface Mini-KVM](https://openterface.com/)** (its keyboard/mouse half) | a real CH9329 behind its CH340 USB-serial adapter | bench-verified |
| **Openterface KVM-Go** | a CH32V208 emulating the CH9329 protocol over its own USB-CDC port; reports `chip_version=0x01` instead of a real chip's `0x38` (see [`notes/openterface-kvm-go.md`](../notes/openterface-kvm-go.md)) | bench-verified, unmodified helper |
| **Sipeed NanoKVM-USB** | same protocol, linked at 57600 baud | should work; not bench-verified here |

The CH9329 *is* the USB HID device, so `ch9329` speaks its **binary frame
protocol** directly (`HEAD 57 AB · ADDR · CMD · LEN · DATA · SUM`); see
[`notes/ch9329-spec.md`](../notes/ch9329-spec.md).

## Wiring it into a target

```bash
# Build/install with everything else (lands in ~/.local/libexec/paniolo/bin):
make install            # from the repo root; or: make rust

# Bind the CH9329 to a target's hid channel (use its CH340 serial device):
paniolo hid set -t winbox --cmd "ch9329 -d /dev/cu.usbserial-4120"

# Drive it — identical to any hid helper:
paniolo hid send -t winbox type "hello world"
paniolo hid send -t winbox combo LEFT_CONTROL S
paniolo hid send -t winbox moveabs 16384 16384   # center; 0..32767 logical
paniolo hid send -t winbox click left
paniolo hid send -t winbox ping
```

Add a `video` channel on the same Openterface's MS2109 capture
(`paniolo video set -t winbox --device "<id>"`) for a full KVM:
`paniolo video shot` for eyes, `ch9329` for hands.

## Commands

The full [HID serial protocol](../docs/dev/hid-serial-protocol.md) §3 surface:
`type`, `key`, `combo`, `down`, `up`, `releaseall`, `move`, `moveabs`, `click`,
`mdown`, `mup`, `scroll`, `ping`, `version`, and `run <file>` for command
sequences.

- **Key names** are `adafruit_hid` Keycode names (`A`–`Z`, `ENTER`,
  `LEFT_CONTROL`, `FORWARD_SLASH`, `F1`…`F12`, `PRINT_SCREEN`, `SCROLL_LOCK`,
  `PAUSE`, `NUM_LOCK`, `APPLICATION`).
- **`type`** assumes a **US layout** and rejects a character it can't type with
  `ERR`.
- **`combo`** chords at most 6 non-modifier keys and refuses more with `ERR`.
- **`version`** reports `1 ch9329/0.1.0 moveabs`: it has a true absolute
  pointer. It does *not* advertise `baud` (see
  [`baud`](#extras-beyond-hidrig) below).

### Extras beyond hidrig

- **`ch9329 -d <dev> info`**: CH9329 `GET_INFO`. Reports firmware version,
  whether the target has enumerated the emulated HID (`target_connected`),
  lock-LED state, and the negotiated baud. Useful for `paniolo doctor`-style
  checks.
- **`ch9329 -d <dev> usb host|target|state`**: switch or query the USB mux that
  shares the onboard microSD reader between host and target. **Openterface
  KVM-Go** only; a real CH9329 lacks it. Wired into paniolo as the `usb` channel
  (`paniolo usb attach-host|attach-target|state`, docs/usb.md); protocol in
  notes/openterface-usb-mux-spec.md.
  - All three print the resulting side; `host`/`target` fail if the mux did not
    move.
  - A device without a mux never answers, so the wait times out and the daemon
    reports "this device does not support USB mux switching". A `usb state`
    query on ordinary hardware does not trigger a reopen (each reopen briefly toggles DTR/RTS, which resets a
    KVM-Go's MCU).
- **`ch9329 -d <dev> baud <rate>`**: **persistently** set the chip's serial
  baud (`SET_PARA_CFG` → flash → `RESET` to activate), then reconnect at the new
  rate. Range 1200..=115200 (Openterface default 115200; NanoKVM-USB 57600;
  factory chips 9600). The `RESET` re-enumerates the USB HID, so the target
  briefly sees the keyboard/mouse disconnect.
  - Unlike the protocol's transient `baud`, this survives power-cycle, so
    `version` does not advertise it and the daemon never calls it.
- **`-b/--baud <rate>`**: force the link rate for *this* connection without
  changing the chip (default: autodetect 115200, 57600, then 9600). Needed
  after `baud` set a rate outside that list.

## Status and limitations

**Verified end to end** on a chip 0x38 over a CH340 at 115200 into a Raspberry
Pi OS desktop: typing (US layout), special keys (`ENTER`/`ESCAPE`/`CAPS_LOCK`,
confirmed via the lock-LED state in `GET_INFO`), absolute pointer, click and
right-click. The **Openterface KVM-Go** is verified too (`chip_version=0x01`,
115200; see [`notes/openterface-kvm-go.md`](../notes/openterface-kvm-go.md)).
The `baud` command (`notes/ch9329-spec.md` §5) is hardware-verified and
persists across processes.

**Lock keys are held for 200 ms** (`CAPS_LOCK` etc.) before release, because
macOS ignores shorter lock-key presses.

**Two CH9329-on-Linux quirks are worked around in `session.rs`:**

- *Clicks use the **relative** report.* libinput ignores a button change in an
  absolute report at an unchanged coordinate. A zero-motion relative `BTN`
  report clicks at the current pointer, so `moveabs` then `click` lands
  correctly.
- *`moveabs` nudges one unit first*, because the device ignores an absolute
  report equal to its previous one.

**The KVM daemon (`serve`/`stop`) is hardware-verified.** `ch9329 serve` owns
the UART and serves the protocol on a localhost WebSocket (`GET /hid`) plus a
`POST /send` one-shot endpoint. It publishes
`/tmp/paniolo-<uid>/hid/<target>/daemon.json` (port and per-start token) for
paniolo's `console`, so the web-console "Capture input" KVM works.

- While a daemon runs, `paniolo hid send` routes through it, so the CLI and
  browser share the UART.
- The UART uses the blocking `serialport` path on a dedicated thread, because
  tokio-serial's async reads are unreliable on a macOS tty.

**Held state (`down`/`up`/`mdown`/drag) persists across commands only through
the daemon.** Without one, `ch9329 down A` resets per process. `combo` and
`run` sequences still compose within one process.

**Recovery clears the chip's own report.** A fresh `open()` (first start, or a
reopen after a transport error) sends an all-zero keyboard and mouse report once
`GET_INFO` confirms the chip, instead of trusting a blank in-memory `Session`.

- A lost reply is retried once before the daemon reopens.
- `tap`/`combo`/`type` try to release what they pressed if a later step fails.
- Graceful shutdown (`SIGTERM`/Ctrl-C) releases every held key, modifier and
  mouse button. It never touches the USB mux.
