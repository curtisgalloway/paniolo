//! CH9329 serial-to-HID protocol session.
//!
//! The WCH CH9329 bridges framed UART commands to a USB HID keyboard + mouse
//! presented to the *target*. Frames are
//! `HEAD(57 AB) ADDR(00) CMD LEN DATA SUM`, `SUM = Σ(all preceding) & 0xFF`;
//! the chip replies `CMD|0x80` (ok) or `CMD|0xC0` (error). See
//! `docs/ch9329-spec.md` for the clean-room protocol reference, restated from
//! the WCH datasheet. The framing, checksum, and GET_INFO paths here are
//! verified against real hardware (chip version 0x38 over a CH340 adapter).
//!
//! A [`Session`] also tracks the *held* report state (modifiers, key slots,
//! mouse buttons, last absolute position) so `combo`/`down`/`mdown` compose
//! within one process — the chip itself only remembers the last report it was
//! given.
