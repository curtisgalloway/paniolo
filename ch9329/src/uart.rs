//! The UART owner: a single dedicated thread that owns the CH9329 control UART
//! (one long-lived [`Session`]) and serializes every command — CLI-injected and
//! WebSocket-injected alike — onto the one wire, one in flight. That single
//! queue is what makes events from the web console and the CLI intermix
//! correctly, and it is what makes held state (`down`/`mdown`/drag) work: the
//! one persistent `Session` carries the modifier/button report across commands,
//! which a one-shot CLI invocation cannot.
//!
//! It uses the **blocking** `serialport` path (the same one the one-shot CLI
//! uses), not async I/O: tokio-serial's async reads do not get reliable
//! read-readiness on a macOS tty. The thread bridges to the async axum server
//! via tokio channels — `blocking_recv` for requests, `oneshot`/`broadcast`
//! sends for replies.
//!
//! The `Session` is opened lazily and dropped on transport error, so the daemon
//! recovers across adapter replug and target power cycles without a restart.
