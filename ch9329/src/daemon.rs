//! Daemon lifecycle for `ch9329 serve`: advisory lock, discovery file, tokio
//! runtime, graceful shutdown. Mirrors hidrig (and serialcap/hdmicap) so they
//! all read the same way and paniolo discovers them identically.
//!
//! The discovery directory is the **channel** name `hid` (not `ch9329`), under
//! `/tmp/paniolo-<uid>/hid/daemon.json`, so paniolo finds the daemon without
//! knowing which helper implements the channel — a `ch9329` daemon and a
//! `hidrig` daemon are interchangeable from paniolo's side. The file records
//! the owned `device` so a CLI one-shot can tell whether the running daemon
//! owns *its* UART before routing through it.
